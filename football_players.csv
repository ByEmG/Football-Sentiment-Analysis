Neymar,"Neymar da Silva Santos Júnior (Brazilian Portuguese pronunciation: [nejˈmaʁ dɐ ˈsiwvɐ ˈsɐ̃tus ˈʒũɲoʁ] ⓘ; born 5 February 1992), also known as Neymar Júnior or simply Neymar, is a Brazilian professional footballer who plays as a left winger, attacking midfielder or forward for Campeonato Brasileiro Série A team Santos, whom he captains, and the Brazil national team. Often praised as one of the best players of all time, he is known for his flair, dribbling, playmaking, and finishing.[8] He is Brazil's all-time top goalscorer.

Neymar made his professional debut with Santos in 2009. In 2011, he was awarded the league's Best Player and won the FIFA Puskás Award for a solo effort in the league. In the same year, he helped Santos win their first Copa Libertadores in nearly 50 years.[9] In 2013, he joined Barcelona and became part of an attacking trio with Lionel Messi and Luis Suárez, dubbed MSN. Winning the continental treble of La Liga, the Copa del Rey, and the UEFA Champions League in the trio's first season, Neymar was the joint-top goalscorer of the Champions League campaign and top goalscorer of the Copa del Rey. In his final season, Neymar reached 100 goals for Barcelona and set the record for most assists in a Champions League campaign. During his time at Barcelona, he was named in the FIFA FIFPro World11 twice and made the podium for the FIFA Ballon d'Or in 2015 and 2017.

Motivated to be the focal player, Neymar joined Paris Saint-Germain (PSG) in 2017 for a transfer worth €222 million, making him the most expensive player ever.[note 1] Evolving into a complete playmaker, he largely contributed to PSG's continuation of Ligue 1 title dominance, winning five titles. Individually, he was named the Player of the Year in his debut season and was named in the Team of the Year three times. In the Champions League, he was integral to PSG reaching its first final in 2020, being named in the UEFA Team of the Year for the second time in his career. Having scored over 100 goals for PSG, he became only the fourth player ever to have scored at least 100 goals for three different clubs. Continuing injuries caused PSG to sell Neymar in 2023 to Al Hilal for €90 million, a Saudi Pro League record transfer. He rarely played due to a year-long ACL injury and returned to his boyhood club Santos in January 2025.

At 18, Neymar debuted for Brazil. He is the nation's all-time top goalscorer, with 79 goals in 128 matches, and is widely regarded as the best Brazilian player of his generation. He won the 2013 FIFA Confederations Cup, winning the Golden Ball. In the 2014 FIFA World Cup, he was named in the Dream Team. He captained Brazil to their first Olympic gold medal in men's football in the 2016 Summer Olympics having already won a silver medal at the 2012 edition. He appeared at the 2018 World Cup, and three years later helped Brazil finish runner-up to Argentina in the 2021 Copa América, being jointly awarded Best Player. In preparation for the 2022 World Cup, Neymar became Brazil's all-time top scorer in FIFA World Cup qualification matches, with 12 goals. In the 2022 World Cup, he became the third Brazilian player to score in three World Cups after Pelé and Ronaldo. He has won a record six Samba Gold awards.

Neymar was born in Mogi das Cruzes, São Paulo, to Neymar Santos Sr. and Nadine da Silva and had a Christian upbringing.[12][13] He inherited his name from his father, who is a former footballer and became his son's advisor as Neymar's talents began to grow.[14] Neymar comments on his father's role: ""My father has been by my side since I was little. He takes care of things, my finances and my family.""[15] Growing up, Neymar combined his love of futsal with street football.[16] Neymar said that futsal had a massive influence on him growing up, helping him develop his technique, speed of thought and ability to perform moves in tight spaces.[17]

In 2003, Neymar moved with his family to São Vicente, where he began playing for youth side Portuguesa Santista.[18] Then, later in 2003, they moved to Santos, where Neymar joined Santos.[19] With the success of his youth career and added income, the family bought their first property, a house next to Vila Belmiro, Santos' home stadium. Their quality of family life improved, as at age 15, Neymar was earning 10,000 reais per month and at 16, 125,000 reais per month. At 17, he signed his first full professional contract, was upgraded to the Santos first team, and began signing his first sponsorship deals.[20]

Neymar began playing football at an early age and he was soon spotted by Santos who offered him a contract in 2003; where he was inducted into their youth academy, which has, in the past, produced Brazilian internationals like Coutinho, Clodoaldo, Diego, Elano and Alex. He also joined the likes of Pepe, Pelé and Robinho in starting out his career at the club, nicknamed Peixe.[21] While in the youth academy, Neymar met Paulo Henrique Ganso, becoming good friends in the process. Aged 14, Neymar travelled to Spain for try outs with the Real Madrid youth team. He did not stay in Madrid, however, as his father decided at the time that he preferred the young prodigy to keep growing up while playing at Santos.[22][23]

Neymar made his professional debut on 7 March 2009, despite being only 17 years old. He was brought on for the last thirty minutes, in a 2–1 win against Oeste.[16] The following week he scored his first goal for Santos against Mogi Mirim. One month later, on 11 April, Neymar scored the decisive goal in a 2–1 win against Palmeiras in the 2009 Campeonato Paulista semi-final first leg.[24] In the final, however, Santos suffered a 4–2 aggregate defeat to Corinthians.[25] In his first season, Neymar racked up 14 goals in 48 games.[16]

""The 18-year-old is a magnificent prospect. He is sleek and skilful, able to beat the defender on either side, capable of combining well, and full of tricks he can put to productive use in and around the penalty area.""

He continued his rapid development in 2010, and, on 15 April, he scored five goals for Santos in an 8–1 rout of Guarani in the qualifying stages of the Brazilian Cup.[27] Following the 2010 Campeonato Paulista in which Neymar scored 14 goals in 19 games,[21] including two in the second leg of the finals against Santo André, the club were crowned champions.[28] Neymar was subsequently given the award for the best player in the competition,[29] and his performances for the club drew comparisons to other Brazilians, including Robinho, Alexandre Pato, and Pelé.[30]

In the 2010 summer transfer window, Santos rejected a £12 million bid for him from English Premier League team West Ham United,[31] and later an offer from Chelsea, reported to be in the region of £20 million.[32] Despite the unwillingness of Santos to sell and Neymar himself stating: ""I'm focused only on Santos"",[33] his agent, Wagner Ribeiro, indicated that Neymar's career was elsewhere, stating: ""He wants to become the best player in the world. The chances of him doing that while playing in Brazil are zero.""[32] One year later Neymar said, in an interview with the Daily Telegraph, that he had been happy with Chelsea's interest in him as it was a ""dream"" of his ""to play in Europe"", while also stating that at the time it had been the right decision to stay in Brazil.[34]

On 5 May 2010, Neymar scored a goal in the 3-1 Copa do Brasil quarterfinals victory over Atletico-MG.[35] He missed the first leg of the semifinals against Grêmio due to a suspension, but returned for the second leg and Santos advanced 6-5 on aggregate. In the first leg of the finals against Vitória, Neymar scored a goal and missed a penalty in a 2-0 win for Peixe.[36] Although Santos lost the return leg 2-1, the 3-2 aggregate score was enough for Santos to lift the Copa do Brasil for the first time in its history, and Neymar finished as the tournament's top scorer with 11 goals.[37]

On 30 November 2010, Santos sold a 5% share of future transfer fees that he would receive to an investment group, Terceira Estrela Investimentos S.A. (TEISA), for R$ 3,549,900 (€1.5 million).[38] The previous year, his family had sold a 40% stake in Neymar's sporting rights to the DIS Esporte group, who had been a long-term strategic partner of the club.[39]

In the league, Neymar shined, scoring 17 goals, including a hat trick against Goiás (4-1) and a brace against Atletico-MG (2-2). He finished second in the top scoring charts, behind Gremio's Jonas.

Neymar concluded the season with 42 goals in 60 matches in all competitions. Despite these impressive numbers, problems had been identified, namely Neymar's apparent taste for diving when tackled, rather than attempting to continue his run, and his attitude. The latter came to the forefront during a league match against Atlético Goianiense, on 15 September 2010, when Santos' manager, Dorival Júnior, appointed another player to take the penalty awarded for a foul on Neymar.[40] His decision was based on the fact that Neymar had missed a crucial penalty during the Copa do Brasil final that year, even if Santos went on to win. Reacting to this, Neymar turned his back on his manager, had to be calmed down by a linesman and argued with his captain, Edu Dracena. The fallout from this event was that Dorival Júnior wished to have Neymar suspended for two weeks, but the board sided with the player and promptly sacked the manager, with Neymar later apologizing.[16] In December 2010, aged just 18, Neymar came third for the 2010 South American Footballer of the Year, behind Andrés D'Alessandro and Juan Sebastián Verón.[41]

Despite scoring only four goals in the 2011 Campeonato Paulista, Neymar scored crucial goals during the 2011 season; he scored the only goal of the quarterfinals matchup against Ponte Preta,[42] and then scored the winning goal in the second leg of the finals against Corinthians to help his club clinch back-to-back state titles.[43] Neymar scored six goals during Santos' run to the 2011 Copa Libertadores Finals, tying him for third top goalscorer,[44] including the clinching goal of Santos' 4–3 aggregate win over Cerro Porteño in the semi-finals.[45] In the two-legged final, Santos faced Uruguayan side Peñarol and drew the first leg 0–0 in Montevideo.[46] At home in the second leg, Neymar opened the scoring in the 46th minute as Santos held on for a 2–1 win and Neymar won Man of the Match honours.[47][48] The win brought Santos their first Copa Libertadores triumph since 1963, when Pelé was playing for the club.[49][50]

On 27 July 2011, Neymar scored his first goals of that year's Campeonato Brasileiro, scoring two goals in a thrilling match against Ronaldinho's Flamengo, but could not prevent defeat for his team as they lost 5–4.[51] His first goal, a spectacular solo dribble, later won the 2011 FIFA Puskás Award.

In September 2011, Santos club president Luís Ribeiro threatened to report Real Madrid to FIFA following reports that they had attempted to sign Neymar to a pre-contract agreement, and denied that such an agreement was in place.[52] On 29 October, Neymar scored four goals and had two disallowed in a 4-1 victory over Atletico Paranaense.[53] On 9 November, Neymar and Santos agreed to a contract extension that would see the player stay with the club until after the 2014 World Cup. The deal reportedly increased Neymar's wages by 50%, to the levels that top European clubs would be paying him.[54] On 14 December, Neymar scored the opening goal for Santos as they defeated Kashiwa Reysol 3–1 in the semi-finals of the FIFA Club World Cup in Toyota, Japan, but made a very small impact in the final against Barcelona on 18 December, where Santos were defeated 4–0.[55] On 31 December, he won the 2011 South American Footballer of the Year award for the first time, by a record margin, following in the footsteps of Diego Maradona, Romário, Pelé and Zico.[56]

On 5 February 2012, when he turned 20, Neymar scored his 100th goal as a professional football player, against Palmeiras in the Campeonato Paulista.[57][58] On 25 February – he scored two goals, one of which was from 25-yards – and created two assists to help his side to a 6–1 win over Ponte Preta.[59] On 7 March, Neymar netted a hat-trick as Santos saw off Brazilian rivals Internacional with a 3–1 win in the Copa Libertadores group stage.[60] On 29 March, he scored a brace against Guaratinguetá in a 5–0 victory.[61] In the fixture against São Paulo on 29 April 2012, Neymar scored a hat-trick with the match ending 3–1.[62] Thereafter, he went on to score twice in the first[63] and second legs[64] in the 2012 Campeonato Paulista Finals against Guarani, which ended 7–2 on aggregate. Neymar finished the 2012 Campeonato Paulista with 20 goals and was voted the Best Player and Best Forward, and Santos were crowned champions. He was joint top scorer in the Copa Libertadores with eight goals, after Santos were beaten over two legs by eventual champions Corinthians in the semi-finals 2-1 on aggregate, with Neymar scoring once in the second leg.

On 25 August 2012, he scored a brace in the 2–1 away win at Palmeiras.[65] On 3 November, in the league fixture away at Cruzeiro, Neymar scored a hat-trick and assisted Felipe Anderson's goal, to help his side to a 4–0 win.[66] Neymar finished off the 2012 season in style, first setting-up Victor Andrade's equaliser, then scoring twice, to give Santos a 3–1 home win over Palmeiras on 1 December.[67] Neymar was voted the Best Player of the 2012 Recopa Sudamericana, scoring in the second leg to assist Santos in winning the title, 2–0 on aggregate against U. de Chile. Neymar finished the 2012 season with 43 goals, one more than his breakthrough 2010 season, but this time doing it in just 47 matches instead of 60. Due to his performances, Neymar was awarded the Bola de Ouro for the second consecutive time. He was one of three finalists in the 2012 FIFA Puskás Award and finished runner-up behind Miroslav Stoch. He won the 2012 South American Footballer of the Year, retaining his award and winning it ahead of the likes of Ronaldinho.[68]

Neymar started the 2013 Campeonato Paulista scoring twice in the first match, which ended a 3–1 win over São Bernardo on 19 January 2013.[69] On 3 February, in the Paulista fixture against São Paulo, Santos won 3–1 with Neymar scoring and making two assists.[70] On 18 March, Neymar told that he had a ""dream of playing in Europe, for a big club like Barcelona, Real Madrid and Chelsea."" He went on to say, ""There's no point in speculating when I'll leave Santos. I'll leave when I want to.""[71]

Neymar scored all four goals, had another disallowed and hit the post as Santos beat União Barbarense 4–0 in the Paulista on 13 April.[72] On 25 April, his agent and father revealed that Neymar intended to leave for Europe before the 2014 FIFA World Cup.[73] Neymar finished the state league campaign with 12 goals, and was runner-up in the top scorers charts, as Santos finished state league runner-up to Corinthians. Ahead of his last match for Santos, on 26 May against Flamengo in the first round of the 2013 Brazilian Championship, Neymar was in tears during the national anthem, with the match ending in a draw.[74]

On 24 May 2013, Santos announced that they had received two offers for Neymar. The following day, Neymar announced he would sign with Barcelona on 27 May and join the team after playing in the 2013 FIFA Confederations Cup. Neither Neymar nor the clubs released details on the transfer fee or personal terms, save to say he signed a five-year deal.[75] On 3 June, Neymar was unveiled by Barcelona after passing medical tests and signing a contract that would keep him at the club through June 2018.[76]

Neymar was presented at the Camp Nou in front of 56,500 fans, a record turnout for a Brazilian player.[77] Club vice-president Josep Maria Bartomeu initially said Neymar's transfer fee was €57.1 million and his release clause set at €190 million.[78][79] Barcelona's doctor suggested he might need to gain weight to be able to cope physically in Spanish football.[80]

In January 2014, the prosecutor's office in Madrid began investigating the transfer fee that Barcelona paid for Neymar.[81] The documents submitted to the authorities on request contained contradictory information.[81] On 23 January 2014, Rosell resigned from his position as president.[82] A day later, the details of the transfer were revealed by Barcelona; the transfer had in fact cost them €86.2 million (£71.5 million),[83][84][85] with Neymar's parents confirmed to have received a €40 million sum.[86][87] In the aftermath, Barcelona and Bartomeu were charged with tax fraud.[88]

On 30 July 2013, Barcelona drew 2–2 against Lechia Gdańsk in a pre-season friendly; Neymar made his unofficial debut when he came on as a substitute.[89] He scored his first goal for the club in a 7–1 win against a Thailand XI on 7 August at the Rajamangala National Stadium.[90] Neymar made his competitive debut for Barcelona during the opening game of the 2013–14 La Liga season as a 63rd-minute substitute for Alexis Sánchez in a 7–0 win against Levante.[91] On 21 August, he scored his first competitive goal for the club in the first leg of the 2013 Supercopa de España against Atlético Madrid: seven minutes after coming on as a substitute for Pedro, he headed Dani Alves' cross to equalise in a 1–1 draw at the Vicente Calderón Stadium as Barcelona won on the away goals rule for his first trophy at the club.[92] On 18 September, he made his UEFA Champions League debut, assisting a Gerard Piqué goal as Barça beat Ajax 4–0 in their opening match of the 2013–14 tournament.

Six days later, Neymar scored his first goal in La Liga in Barcelona's 4–1 defeat of Real Sociedad at Camp Nou.[93] On 26 October, he made his first El Clásico appearance, scoring the opening goal and assisting the team's winning goal scored by Alexis Sánchez as Barcelona beat Real Madrid 2–1 at Camp Nou.[94] On 11 December, Neymar recorded his first three Champions League goals as he scored a hat-trick in a 6–1 win over Celtic in Barcelona's final Group H match.[95]

On 13 September 2014, after appearing as a substitute, Neymar scored his first two goals of the 2014–15 season, helping Barcelona beat Athletic Bilbao 2–0. On 27 September, he scored a hat-trick against Granada in a 6–0 win[96] and scored in his next three La Liga matches, including the opening goal in a 1–3 loss to Real Madrid at Estadio Santiago Bernabéu.[97]

On 24 January 2015, Neymar scored twice and assisted two more goals in a 6–0 win at Elche.[98] On 28 January, he scored his 20th goal of the season in a 3–2 Copa del Rey quarter-final win over Atlético Madrid.[99] On 4 March, Neymar scored twice in Barcelona's 3–1 Copa del Rey semi-final win over Villarreal to qualify the club for its 37th Spanish Cup final.[100] On 21 April, Neymar took his tally to 30 goals for the season by scoring twice in Barcelona's 2–0 Champions League quarter-final win over Paris Saint-Germain (PSG).[101]

In May, the closing month of the season, Neymar scored the last goal in a 3–0 win against Bayern Munich in the first leg of the Champions League semi-final.[102] A week later, he scored both the team's goals in a 3–2-second leg defeat at the Allianz Arena to ensure Barça would qualify for the 2015 UEFA Champions League Final.[103] He also opened the scoring with a header in a 2–0 league win versus Real Sociedad, a result which gave Barça a four-point lead over Real Madrid with only two matches remaining.[104]

After securing the league title on 17 May with a 1–0 win over Atlético Madrid at the Vicente Calderón, Barcelona defeated Athletic Bilbao 3–1 at Camp Nou in the 2015 Copa del Rey Final on 30 May, with Neymar scoring the second goal for Barça.[105] With Barcelona's victory likely, he performed tricks with the ball in the final stages of the game, which was deemed unsporting by opponent Andoni Iraola. Barcelona manager Luis Enrique claimed that it had to be understood that such behaviour was acceptable in Brazil, while Neymar himself did not apologise.[106]

On 6 June, Neymar scored the third goal for Barça in the 3–1 Champions League Final defeat of Italian champions Juventus at Berlin's Olympiastadion, ensuring the club won its fifth European Cup.[107] This made Barcelona the first club in history to twice win the treble of domestic league, domestic cup and European Cup.[108] On a personal note, he became the eighth player in football's history to win both the Copa Libertadores and the UEFA Champions League, and the first player to score in final victories in both competitions.[109] Neymar ended the season with 39 goals in all competitions and 10 in the Champions League, making him joint highest scorer with Cristiano Ronaldo and teammate Lionel Messi in the latter competition.[110] He was the first player apart from those two to top the competition's scoring list, since compatriot Kaká in 2006–07.[111] Barcelona's attacking trio of Messi, Luis Suárez and Neymar, dubbed ""MSN"", ended with 122 goals, the most in a season for an attacking trio in Spanish football history.[112]

Due to having the mumps, Neymar was expected to miss the 2015 UEFA Super Cup and the 2015 Supercopa de España.[113] On 17 October, Neymar scored four goals in Barcelona's 5–2 home win over Rayo Vallecano in La Liga, taking his total to eight goals for the season.[114] On 21 November, Neymar scored one and provided a back heel assist for Andrés Iniesta in Barcelona's 4–0 away win against Real Madrid.[115] He scored twice in a 4–0 home win over Real Sociedad on 28 November, taking his La Liga total to 14 goals in 12 games.[116] On 30 November, Neymar was shortlisted for the 2015 FIFA Ballon d'Or alongside Messi and Ronaldo, and subsequently came third.[117][118] On 22 May 2016, Neymar scored a late goal in Barcelona's 2–0 extra time win over Sevilla in the 2016 Copa del Rey Final at the Vicente Calderón, as the club celebrated winning the domestic double for the second consecutive season, following their treble victory from the previous season.[119][120] The front three of Messi, Suárez and Neymar finished the season with 131 goals, breaking the record they had set the previous year for most goals by an attacking trio in a single season.[121]

""While there is a 1% chance, we will have99% faith.""

In Barcelona's 6–1 victory over PSG in the Champions League round of 16, Neymar had a miraculous and heroic role in Barcelona's comeback, by scoring two goals and assisted the decisive goal of Sergi Roberto during the closing seven-minute sequence, of which he was named man of the match, based on his efforts.[123][124] Overcoming the 4–0 loss to PSG in the first leg from 14 February 2017, this second leg match became the biggest comeback in Champions League history.[125]

On 2 April, Neymar scored his 100th goal for Barcelona in his 177th appearance for the club, netting in a 4–1 win over Granada.[126][127] On 27 May, Neymar scored in the 2017 Copa del Rey Final, his 105th goal for the club, as Barcelona defeated Alavés 3–1 at the Vicente Calderón in Madrid.[128]

Desire to leave Barcelona

According to former Barcelona teammate Xavi, Neymar informed his teammates of his desire to leave Barcelona at Messi's wedding in June 2017.[129] By July 2017, media speculation emerged that Neymar wanted to join PSG, with the club holding talks with Barcelona officials. At 25-years old, Neymar was motivated to leave Barcelona to step out of Messi's shadow and be the sole star player, increasing the likelihood of him winning the Ballon d'Or.[130] Barcelona president, Bartomeu, admitted he was powerless to stop him from wanting to leave: ""Neymar is one of our best players and so we don't want to lose that player,"" he said. ""We want him to continue with us. He still has four years of his contract so there is nothing else to say [...] You know that players decide if they want to leave, they can decide.""[131] On 2 August 2017, Neymar asked Barcelona to allow him to leave.[132]

On 3 August 2017, Barcelona announced that Neymar's legal representatives made a payment of €222 million[133] to the club, equal to the release clause of his contract, which constituted the most expensive transfer ever. The club informed UEFA so that they can determine any disciplinary responsibilities that may arise from this case.[10] According to the BBC, in Spain, the release clause must be activated by the footballer himself. The situation was unusual, in that the fee was paid to the club directly, after La Liga had refused to receive the payment.[134][11] Usually, the buyout clause is deposited with La Liga in order to release the player from his contract, and the league then passes the money to the selling club. However, La Liga rejected the payment—citing violation of Financial Fair Play (FFP) rules by PSG, who are backed by money from Gulf state Qatar.[135] 2017–18 Paris Saint-Germain FC season

Neymar joined PSG on a contract that would run until 2022.[136] He was offered the number 10 shirt by Javier Pastore as a ""welcome gift"".[137][138] It was believed that PSG signed Neymar to increase their chances of winning the Champions League.[139]

The relationship between Neymar and Barcelona fans was tainted following his unexpected transfer to PSG, with some fans burning Barcelona jerseys with Neymar's name on it.[140] In his presentation on 17 August, Neymar said that leaving Barcelona was one of the toughest decisions in his life.[141] The presentation was reported to have been watched by 85 million viewers in Brazil.[142] Neymar was unequivocally considered the star player of Ligue 1; Lille's general director Marc Ingla credited the presence of Neymar in Ligue 1 to potentially accelerating it into a powerhouse league in Europe, alongside the Premier League and La Liga.[143]

On 27 August 2017, Barcelona filed a lawsuit against Neymar, demanding he return the contract renewal bonus he received as well as €8.5 million in damages and an additional 10% for the arrears. They claimed they are owed money that Neymar received as part of a renewal bonus when he signed a new contract in 2016. The club also requested PSG to take on the responsibility for the payment of the fees if the player cannot do so himself.[144] Neymar's lawyers announced that they would contest the case.[145]

Neymar made his debut for Les Rouge-et-Bleu on 13 August 2017, scoring a goal and assisting another in a 3–0 away victory over Guingamp.[146] Highlighting the hype around Neymar's arrival in Paris, the match was broadcast in 183 countries.[147] After the match, Neymar said, ""People think that leaving Barca is to die, but it's the opposite [...] I'm more alive than ever.""[148]

He added two more goals to his tally in the next Ligue 1 fixture against Toulouse.[149] Forming a prolific attacking trio alongside teenage French prodigy Kylian Mbappé and Uruguayan striker Edinson Cavani, Neymar scored one each in PSG's two opening games of the 2017–18 UEFA Champions League group stage, with the team winning 5–0 at Celtic and 3–0 at home over Bayern Munich respectively.[150][151] Neymar finished in third place in the 2017 Ballon d'Or and in the same year was ranked the third-best footballer in the world by The Guardian, both times behind Messi and Ronaldo.[152]

During a 3–0 defeat of rivals Marseille on 25 February 2018, Neymar fractured the fifth metatarsal bone in his right foot. He travelled to Belo Horizonte and underwent a successful operation on his foot.[153] Despite failing to make another appearance for PSG while recovering from the injury, Neymar consequently ended his first season in Paris with 28 goals in 30 matches, including 6 goals in 7 Champions League matches.[154] A testament to the success of his debut season, Neymar was awarded the Ligue 1 Player of the Year.[155]

Neymar was rushed back to play for Brazil at the 2018 World Cup in Russia following the injury in February, but his playing style was not quite the same as he appeared to be avoiding physical contact entirely rather than simply trying to draw fouls.[140]

On 12 August 2018, Neymar scored PSG's opening league goal of the 2018–19 season in a 3–0 win over Caen at Parc des Princes.[156] Neymar scored from a penalty in his next game as PSG won 3–1 against Guingamp in Ligue 1.[157] In the following league game, the front three of Neymar, Mbappé and Cavani all scored in a 3–1 win over Angers at home, with Neymar scoring from Mbappé's cut back and setting up Cavani to score the opener.[158]

On 3 October, Neymar scored a hattrick in a 6–1 win over Red Star Belgrade in a Champions League group stage fixture.[159] He suffered a foot injury in late January 2019 that kept him out of his side's Champions League round of 16 tie against Manchester United.[160] After United eliminated PSG, Neymar went on Instagram insulting video review officials for awarding a stoppage-time penalty to United; UEFA banned Neymar for three matches for the insult.[161]

On 27 April, Neymar scored in the 2019 Coupe de France Final against Rennes, but Rennes made a comeback and won on penalties. After the match, Neymar was caught on video appearing to punch a spectator in the face.[162] The spectator had been filming and insulting PSG players. PSG said they supported Neymar ""100 percent"" over the incident.[161] Neymar admitted he was wrong, but argued that neither he nor anyone else could have stayed indifferent. PSG coach Thomas Tuchel responded: ""It's not easy to climb the stairs after a defeat. If we lose, we must show respect. You can't come into conflict with a spectator.""[162]

In July 2019, Neymar was absent from training with PSG, with the club talking disciplinary action.[163] Neymar wanted to leave PSG as he felt referees never protected him, there was jealousy towards him from some dressing room team-mates, fans did not appreciate his talent showcased in PSG and sections of the French media were against him.[164]

According to Sky Sports News, Neymar was prepared to pay €20m of his own money to PSG in five instalments to facilitate a move to Barcelona. On 27 August 2019, both clubs met to discuss Neymar's situation, but according to PSG sporting director Leonardo, Barcelona's only written offer came during the meeting, which was not enough and PSG refused.[164] Three days later, on 30 August, an offer was made in writing from Neymar to PSG general manager Jean-Claude Blanc. Neymar's offer was dismissed by PSG because of French football federation regulations,[164] and he ultimately agreed to stay at PSG after the talks to return to Barcelona broke down.[165] Sky Sports News also reported that Real Madrid were interested in signing Neymar throughout the transfer window.[165]

Neymar made his first appearance for PSG in the 2019–20 season on 14 September, in a 1–0 victory over Strasbourg in Ligue 1. He scored the winning goal in injury time in the second half from a bicycle kick.[166] One week later, he again scored a late winner, as PSG defeated Lyon 1–0 at the Parc Olympique Lyonnais.[167] Neymar suffered a hamstring injury in October while on international duty with Brazil,[168] and returned to play for PSG during their Champions League group match against Real Madrid on 26 November in a 2–2 draw.

Neymar won his third league title after PSG were awarded Ligue 1 as the season finished early due to the COVID-19 pandemic.[169] In his first 50 matches in Ligue 1, Neymar scored 46 goals, being the first player to do so since Marseille's Gunnar Andersson in the early 1950s.[170] On 24 July 2020, in PSG's first professional game back after the pandemic, Neymar scored his side's lone goal in a 1–0 win over Saint-Étienne in the Coupe de France Final, winning his second Coupe de France title with the club.[171] On 31 July, PSG won the 2020 Coupe de la Ligue Final 6–5 on penalties over Lyon, following a 0–0 draw after extra time, which saw the side complete a domestic treble, with Neymar netting one of the penalties in the shoot-out.[172]

In the Champions League quarter-final against Atalanta on 12 August, Neymar assisted the equalising goal in injury time in an eventual 2–1 win.[173] As a result of his performance in the match, the BBC published an article the following day titled 'Neymar: Is he now the best player in the world?'.[174] In the semi-final against RB Leipzig, he assisted one goal in a 3–0 victory, which saw PSG reach the Champions League final for the first time in their history.[175] Marca were also praiseful of Neymar, considering him the most decisive and the best player in the world following his ""masterclass"" performances leading up to the final.[176] PSG eventually lost out 1–0 to Bayern Munich on 23 August.[177] With his focal ambition of being the talisman to PSG winning its first ever Champions League title, Neymar was distraught and had to be consoled by the club's sporting director Leonardo.[178] Neymar was amongst the nominees for the UEFA Men's Player of the Year Award, being the highest ranked PSG player at fourth place.[179]

Neymar missed out on the first match of the 2020–21 season because he had tested positive for COVID-19 a week earlier;[180] PSG went on to lose the game against Lens 1–0.[181] However, he returned to training before the match against Marseille on 13 September.[182] PSG lost Le Classique for the first time since 2011 as OM were victorious 1–0 in a match that had 14 yellow cards and five red cards handed out by the referee, including one of each to Neymar.[183]

Neymar scored his first two goals of the season in a 6–1 win against Angers on 2 October.[184] He entered the list of the top ten goal scorers in PSG history by doing so, scoring his 72nd for the club, which put him level with Raí.[185] On 28 October, Neymar suffered an adductor injury in a match against İstanbul Başakşehir, leaving the pitch after 26 minutes of play.[186] He made his return to action as a substitute in a 3–2 loss against Monaco on 20 November,[187] and scored his first goal after recovering from his injury in a 1–0 win against RB Leipzig in the UEFA Champions League on 24 November.[188]

On 28 November, Neymar scored his 50th goal in Ligue 1, converting a penalty in PSG's 2–2 draw against Bordeaux. This made him the fastest player in the club's history to reach this, doing so in only 58 matches.[189] Four days later, on 2 December, he scored two goals in a 3–1 Champions League victory against Manchester United at Old Trafford.[190] In PSG's final group match, Neymar scored his third career Champions League hat-trick against İstanbul Başakşehir, as his side won 5–1 and qualified for the knockout stage as group winners.[191] He became the first player in European Cup and Champions League history to score 20 goals for two different clubs, scoring 21 goals for Barcelona in 40 games, and 20 for PSG in 25 games.[192] In a 1–0 loss to Lyon on 13 December, Neymar suffered an ankle injury after a tackle from Thiago Mendes, and had to be stretchered off the field.[193] He avoided a fracture, but was ruled out of action for three weeks with a sprain.[194] His return proved to be exactly one month after his injury, on 13 January 2021, in a 2–1 win over rivals Marseille in the Trophée des Champions, with Neymar scoring the winning goal from a penalty.[195] He sustained a left adductor injury in a 1–0 cup win over Caen on 10 February, ruling him out for four weeks.[196] On 21 March, he was back in action, coming on as a substitute in a 4–2 league win against Lyon.[197]

In the 2020–21 UEFA Champions League, PSG were eliminated by Manchester City in the semi-finals. Neymar was absent for PSG's defeat of Barcelona, but he was present in both matches of the quarter-finals against Bayern Munich and both semi-final confrontations against Man City. On 8 May, he extended his contract with PSG until 2025.[198]

On 10 August 2021, Neymar's former Barcelona teammate Lionel Messi signed for PSG.[199] On 29 August, Neymar made his first appearance of the season, being a starter in a 2–0 win over Reims. Messi replaced Neymar at 66th minute of the match, making his debut for the French club.[200] Neymar scored his first goal of the 2021–22 season on 19 September, converting a penalty in a 2–1 win over Lyon.[201] He scored his 400th career goal on 6 November against Bordeaux, where he scored a brace and helped the team to win the match 3–2.[202]

On 28 November, Neymar suffered an ankle injury in a 3–1 win over Saint-Étienne. He was taken off on a stretcher at the 85th minute of the match.[203] His return from injury came on 15 February 2022 in a Champions League match against Real Madrid, where he came on as a substitute and assisted Mbappé's injury-time goal to win the match 1–0.[204] Four days later, he made his return to league play and his first start in 2022 in a match against Nantes; he scored a goal and missed a penalty in a 3–1 loss at the Stade de la Beaujoire.[205] On 13 March, following their Champions League elimination against Real Madrid in the round of 16, Neymar and his team-mate Messi were booed by some of the PSG fans at the Parc des Princes in the league match against Bordeaux.[206][207] On 21 May, he scored his 100th goal with PSG in a 5–0 win over Metz.[208] Neymar helped PSG win their record-tying 10th national championship, finishing the season with 13 goals and 8 assists across all competitions, registering the fewest goals scored since arriving in Europe in 2013, in a season marked by various injuries and collective irregularity.[209]

Following a disappointing form in the previous season and with the club's change in transfer policy, Neymar was linked with a potential departure from the club, but the lack of potential suitors broke down a potential move, despite PSG's Football Advisor Luís Campos dismissing those rumours – stating that Neymar was part of the club's project.[210] He quickly regained his form from his previous season, starting off the season by scoring a goal and providing a hat-trick of assists in a 5–0 win against Clermont on 6 August.[210][211] As part of his prolific attacking trio alongside Kylian Mbappé and Lionel Messi, on 21 August, all three scored and assisted with Neymar netting twice and registering three more assists in PSG's 7–1 away win over Lille.[212][213]

After registering 13 goal contributions in his first five league games, Neymar was named Ligue 1's Player of the Month in August.[210][214] By early October 2022, Neymar was considered one of the stand-out players in Europe and back to his best form, having scored 11 goals and providing 9 assists in just 13 games.[215] Manager Christophe Galtier praised Neymar for playing his best ever football in PSG.[216] Neymar's form in the first half of the season led him to be touted to win the 2023 Ballon d'Or, alongside the likes of Erling Haaland and Mbappé.[217]

On 6 March 2023, PSG announced that Neymar would undergo surgery in Doha and would be ruled out for the remainder of the season.[218] This led to Neymar missing PSG's second leg of their Champions League round of 16 tie against Bayern Munich, in which PSG ended up being eliminated. After reports that Messi would leave the club following the expiration of his contract, a group of PSG supporters gathered outside the club's headquarters, protesting against the club's direction and insulting various figures of the club, including Neymar. Another group of individuals went to Neymar's house, demanding him to leave the club.[219][220]

""It is naturally difficult to say goodbye to a legend of the club, which Neymar will always be. I will never forget the day he arrived at PSG, nor what he brought to the club and to our project over the course of these six years. We have lived through extraordinary times and Neymar will always be a part of our history. I want to thank him, as well as his family. We wish Neymar the best for the future and for his next adventure.""

Despite being PSG's fourth-highest scorer and winning ten trophies, including five Ligue 1 titles, Neymar's tenure at PSG was marred by injuries and unfulfilled expectations, most notably not helping PSG win a Champions League. He missed 119 matches for PSG in total as a result of being injured around 20 times across his six-year spell, showing a fragility that was not seen either at Barcelona or Santos.[222] James Westwood of Goal wrote that Neymar wasted the best years of his career and that in 2017 he had ""the world at his feet"" playing for Barcelona, throwing away his chance to join Pelé and Messi as a ""true legend of the game"" by joining PSG.[140]

Regardless, Neymar has been credited as a legend of PSG, trailing only Ibrahimović, Cavani, and Mbappé in the club's top scorers at the time of his departure.[148] During his time at PSG, he embraced the role of a true number 10, evolving into a more well-rounded player as he took on greater responsibility in dictating the flow of the game, more so than during his tenure at Barcelona. He also assumed greater priority within the team, being entrusted with set pieces and penalties. His goal-scoring success at PSG made him one of the few players to have scored at least 100 goals for three different clubs,[223] and he also established himself as the highest-scoring Brazilian in the Champions League at the club.[224]

At the end of the 2022–23 season, PSG began a squad overhaul and after not renewing the contracts of Sergio Ramos and Lionel Messi, following the arrival of Luis Enrique as the club's new manager, Neymar and Marco Verratti were informed that they would not be in the team's plans for the following season.[225] Shortly after, Neymar was linked with a potential return to Barcelona. However, Barcelona's hierarchy never reached an advanced stage to discuss finer economic details and possibilities, as the club's manager Xavi was not keen on signing him, leading both clubs to fail to reach an agreement.[226]

On 15 August 2023, Neymar completed a transfer to Saudi Pro League club Al Hilal on a two-year contract, joining a list of European league players who signed for the club.[227][228] The transfer fee was reported to be worth €90 million, making him the most expensive purchase in Saudi Pro League history.[228] He is also reportedly being paid €150m a year at Al Hilal, six times the amount he earned at PSG.[229] As a marquee signing, Neymar's transfer to Al Hilal drew comparisons to former Brazil international Rivellino's transfer to the club in 1978.[230]

According to The Independent, Barcelona were the only European club who showed genuine interest in signing Neymar; other top clubs turned away primarily due to his high salary and the expected transfer fee to sign him.[231] Some media outlets criticised Neymar for choosing to not remain in a top European league and dubbed him as the 'Prince who never became King' due to leaving Europe without winning the Ballon d'Or.[232][233] However, Neymar declared, ""I wouldn't be surprised if the Saudi league is better than the French"", in light of fellow star players joining the league, including Cristiano Ronaldo and Karim Benzema.[230]

On 15 September 2023, he made his club debut in Saudi Arabia during a 6–1 thrashing of Al-Riyadh, coming off the bench and providing an assist to a goal by fellow Brazilian, Malcom.[234] That same year, on 3 October, Neymar scored his first goal for the club in a 3–0 away win against Nassaji Mazandaran in an AFC Champions League group stage match.[235] Having played five games for his new club, Neymar ruptured his anterior cruciate ligament while on international duty in October 2023.[236] In January 2024, Al Hilal deregistered Neymar as a result of his season ending injury, in order to free up one of the eight foreign roster spots for Renan Lodi.[237]

Neymar returned to action on 21 October 2024 during Al Hilal's AFC Champions League match against Al Ain, marking his comeback after a lengthy absence.[238] However, a few weeks later, he suffered a hamstring injury that sidelined him for the rest of the year.[239] In January 2025, Neymar was not registered for the league competition during the second half of the 2024–25 season, in which Al Hilal coach Jorge Jesus stated in the press room: ""Neymar can no longer perform at the level we are used to. Things have become difficult for him, unfortunately"".[240] On 27 January 2025, the club announced an agreement for the termination of his contract by mutual consent.[241]

Neymar totalled one goal and three assists in seven appearances for Al Hilal;[242] various media outlets debated whether Neymar's transfer to the club is the worst transfer in football history.[243][244][245]

On 30 January 2025, Neymar announced through his social media that he would be signing a contract with his first club Santos.[246][247] The following day, Santos confirmed his return.[248] He will wear the number 10, the number which Pelé had worn during his time spent between 1956 and 1974.[249]

Neymar made his re-debut for Peixe on 6 February 2025, coming on as a half-time substitute for Gabriel Bontempo in a 1–1 Campeonato Paulista home draw against Botafogo-SP.[250] According to Reuters, ""The Urbano Caldeira stadium erupted in celebration as jubilant and tearful fans lit up their mobile phones to give the striker, who left the club 12 years ago, a hero's welcome before kick-off.""[251] He received the Man of the Match award after the match.[252]

He scored his first goal after returning ten days later, netting the opener in a 3–1 home win over Água Santa through a penalty; he also assisted Guilherme in the club's third goal, and a Man of the Match award.[253] On 23 February 2025, Neymar scored directly from a corner kick and earned another Man of the Match.[254][255]

Following Neymar's performances for Santos in their successful early 2010 season, including winning the 2010 Copa do Brasil, in which he was the top goalscorer, and the 2010 Campeonato Paulista, in which he scored 14 goals, former Brazilian football players Pelé and Romário reportedly urged coach Dunga to take Neymar to the 2010 World Cup.[33] Although the opinion that Neymar deserved a place in Dunga's squad went as far as a 14,000 signature petition,[33][256] and despite the pressure on Dunga to pick Neymar,[257] he was omitted from both the squad of 23,[258][259] and the stand-by list.[260] Although Dunga described Neymar as ""extremely talented"", he said that the 18-year-old had not been tested sufficiently on the international level to earn a World Cup spot and he had failed to impress enough while on international duty.[261]

On 26 July 2010, Neymar was selected for the first time in the Brazil senior team by new head coach Mano Menezes for a friendly match against the United States to be played in East Rutherford, New Jersey. On 10 August 2010 he made his debut with the national team in that game, aged 18 years old, starting the match and wearing the number 11 jersey. He scored on his debut after 28 minutes, a header coming from an André Santos cross in a 2–0 win for Brazil.[262] On 1 March 2011, Neymar said: ""Being on the Brazilian team is a privilege, There are some marvelous players and I'm very happy to be among them.""[15]

On 27 March 2011, he scored twice in a 2–0 win against Scotland at the Emirates Stadium.[263] During the match against Scotland, a banana was thrown onto the pitch after he scored from the penalty spot, which led Neymar to complain about 'constant jeering and an atmosphere of racism', implying that Scottish fans exhibited racism.[264][265] While Scottish officials explained that Neymar had been booed solely for perceived injury-feigning, a German student who was in the stadium amongst Brazil supporters said that he threw the banana with no racist intentions. This led to the Scottish Football Association asking the Brazilian Football Confederation for an apology for the accusations made to the Scottish fans.[266][267] Neymar refused to apologise or retract his words, claiming he ""did not accuse any person or any group of supporters"".[268][269]

Neymar was the leading goal scorer of the 2011 South American Youth Championship with nine goals, including two in the final, in Brazil's 6–0 win against Uruguay.[270] He also took part at the 2011 Copa América in Argentina, where he scored two goals in the first-round game against Ecuador. He was selected 'Man of the Match' in Brazil's first match against Venezuela, which ended a 1–1 draw. Brazil were eliminated in the quarter-finals in a penalty shoot-out against Paraguay (2–2 a.e.t.), with Neymar being substituted in the 80th minute.[271]

On 11 May 2012, Neymar was selected for the squad of the Brazil Olympic football team to participate in the London 2012 Olympic Games.[272]
In Brazil's first warm-up match on 20 July 2012, against the host nation Great Britain at Riverside Stadium, Neymar was involved in both goals of a 2–0 win, first making an assist with a free-kick into the six-yard box for Sandro's header, before converting a penalty.[273] On 26 July, he scored his first goal in Brazil's opening fixture against Egypt, which ended a 3–2 victory for Brazil.[274] In the following match against Belarus at Old Trafford in Manchester, Neymar scored a free-kick from 25-yards into the top-right corner of the goal and set up goals for Alexandre Pato's header with a cross from the right and Oscar with a back heel as Brazil secured their place in the quarter-finals with a 3–1 win. Afterwards he said: ""I scored and made two assists so for me it was perfect"".[275][276]

On 5 August 2012, in the quarter-final encounter against Honduras, Neymar scored a penalty, his third goal of the tournament and assisted in Leandro Damião's second goal on the match, to help Brazil to a 3–2 victory at St James' Park and book a place in the semi-finals.[277] On 11 August, Brazil lost 2–1 to Mexico in the final at Wembley Stadium in London.[278]

On 2 June, Neymar was named in the Brazil squad for the 2014 FIFA World Cup.[290] Going into the tournament, as the team's star player Neymar was expected to lead Brazil to their sixth World Cup success, and first title on home soil.[291] One week prior to the team's opening match, Neymar scored once and made two assists in a 4–0 friendly win over Panama.[292]

Neymar earned his 50th international cap in the opening match of the tournament, on 12 June against Croatia in São Paulo. In the 26th minute, with Croatia leading 1–0, Neymar elbowed Croatian midfielder Luka Modrić, after which Neymar was issued a yellow card.[293] Many critics agreed that Neymar's punishment was too lenient and that he should have been issued a red card.[294][295][296] He equalised before half-time with a shot from outside the box and gave Brazil the lead in the second half with a penalty kick, following a controversial decision by the referee, in an eventual 3–1 win.[297] In the third group match, he again scored twice as the Seleção defeated Cameroon 4–1 to reach the knockout stage.[298] In the round of 16 against Chile, the match finished 1–1 after 120 minutes and was decided by a penalty shoot-out with Neymar scoring what proved to be the winning kick for Brazil.[299]

In the quarter-final win over Colombia, while challenging for the ball, Neymar was kneed in the back by Juan Camilo Zúñiga and had to be removed from the pitch on a stretcher. A hospital scan revealed that Neymar had suffered a fractured vertebra in his spine and he missed the rest of the World Cup.[300] Earlier in the match, Neymar assisted Thiago Silva's opening goal with a cross from a corner kick.[301] It was the second Neymar assist from a corner in the tournament, after creating David Luiz's goal in the previous round against Chile.[299] Without their injured talisman Neymar (and the suspended captain Thiago Silva), Brazil would ultimately lose in the semi-final in a stunning 7–1 defeat to eventual champion Germany on 8 July.[302]

After the final whistle, he was red carded for deliberately kicking the ball at Pablo Armero, and as a result was pushed over by Colombian striker Carlos Bacca, who was also dismissed.[310] CONMEBOL issued Neymar with a four-match ban, ruling him out for the remainder of the tournament, in addition to a $10,000 fine.[311]

The CBF had wanted Neymar to play at the Copa América Centenario and the Olympics in Rio during the summer of 2016, but after a request from Barcelona manager Luis Enrique, he was rested from the first tournament.[312] In late June 2016, he was subsequently one of the three over-23 players to be included in Brazil's squad for the 2016 Summer Olympics on home soil, and was named the team's captain by the Olympic side's manager Rogério Micale.[313][314]

On 2 July, Neymar scored his second goal of the World Cup in a 2–0 win over Mexico in the last 16, while also assisting Roberto Firmino for his goal.[326] After the Mexico game, BBC Sport wrote that despite Neymar's ""good performances"" coming up top in several statistics at the World Cup, ""there is still a sense that he remains widely unpopular among neutrals"" due to his ""petulance and the play-acting"". Meanwhile, Brazilian newspaper O Globo wrote that ""Neymar has charmed Brazil, but annoyed the whole world"".[327] On 6 July, Brazil were eliminated after losing 2–1 against Belgium in the quarter-finals, with Neymar denied an injury time equaliser by a finger-tip save from Belgium goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois.[328]

'Keep inspiring us. I will keep punching the air with joy for every goal you score'

On 8 September 2023, Neymar scored twice for Brazil in a 5–1 win over Bolivia in their opening match for 2026 FIFA World Cup qualification. His 78th and 79th goals in his 125th appearance for Brazil, Neymar became the national team's top goalscorer ahead of Pelé.[353][354] Mimicking Pelé's punch in the air goal celebration with the first of his two goals, Neymar stated after the game that he never imagined he would reach the record.[354][355] On 17 October, in Brazil's 2–0 qualifying defeat to Uruguay, Neymar was taken off in tears on a stretcher at the end of the first half, following an awkward landing after a challenge. Neymar would confirm later that week that he had ruptured his ACL and meniscus completely in his left knee and would need to undergo surgery, likely ruling him out for the remainder of the 2023–24 campaign;[236] consequently, he was left out of Brazil's squad for the 2024 Copa América.[356]

On 2 March 2025, Neymar was named in the 29 men in the preliminary squad for the national team.

Neymar primarily plays as a winger or  attacking midfielder and has been described in the media as ""a true phenomenon"";[358][359] Highlighting both his prolific scoring and playmaking abilities, he stands as PSG's fourth-highest-goalscorer of all time and fifth-highest-assister of all time.[360] He often plays as a left winged for both club and country in the team's 4–3–3 formation due to his pace and playmaking skills; this position allows him to shoot with his stronger foot and create chances for teammates.[359]

According to Westwood of Goal,

""[Neymar] is a master dribbler, and he sees openings that other players don't. He can create chances out of nothing and more often than not, has the finishing touch or decisive final pass to match his ingenuity on the ball.""[140]

Neymar's dribbling skills and playmaking ability have been described as reminiscent of Brazilian compatriot Ronaldinho. His main traits are his vision, passing, finishing, dribbling, feints, and first touch, being described as both ""electric"" and ""explosive"".[361][362][363] He is known for using the  rainbow flick.[364] A prolific goalscorer,[365]  Neymar is two-footed and can even score free-kicks and penalties.[359][366] Neymar stated: ""I'm always trying to perfect everything – dribbling, shooting, headers and control. You can always improve"".[15] He has been inspired by Ronaldinho, Lionel Messi, Cristiano Ronaldo, Andrés Iniesta, Xavi, and Wayne Rooney.[367][368] Neymar cites Kyle Walker as the toughest opponent he has ever faced.[369]

Considered to be a highly promising player in his youth,[370] Brazilian playmaker Ronaldinho had also tipped Neymar on becoming the best player in the world, stating in 2013: ""Neymar is young though, and I can't explain how special he will become. In the next two or three seasons he will become the best player.""[371] Another Brazilian legend Ronaldo also believed that Neymar could become the best in the world, commenting: ""Logically, Messi is better right now but Neymar is a great talent who will show the world that he will be number one"".[372] Former Real Madrid sporting director Jorge Valdano has also praised Neymar, stating: ""I like Neymar a lot. Many of his individual actions result in a goal and often it's a move that only seems to be happening with him on the pitch.""[373] After joining Barcelona, Neymar established himself as one of the best footballers in the world, generally being considered the third-best player of his generation behind Messi and Ronaldo.[374][375][376] Neymar is also widely regarded as the best Brazilian player of his generation.[377][378]

""And so, circus Neymar arrived in Dortmund. The Brazilian's moods, histrionics, petulance, and goalscoring prowess were on view in every fascinating and exasperating detail.""

However, Neymar also has been known and criticised for his excessive diving[380][381][382][383] when tackled by another player. Brazilian legend Pelé has said, ""[h]e is a player with a body that can't take a lot of hits. [...] A lot of times he will fall because he can't do anything else, but he was overdoing it."" He continued: ""Even when he is fouled, he can't make a spectacle out of it"".[384] During the 2018 World Cup, Neymar inspired on the “Neymar Challenge” on social media due to his dramatic dives.[385][386] As the star player for Brazil and PSG, he is often the most targeted player on the field; in 2018, he was the most fouled player in the top five leagues.[387] A divisive figure in the sport, he has been accused of exaggerating injury, with Eric Cantona stating Neymar is a ""great actor"", comparing him to a wheeled suitcase: ""you barely touch it, and it turns round and round for hours.""[388][389] In response to the criticism over his petulance and histrionics, Neymar starred in a commercial after the 2018 World Cup where he said that he wasn't able to control his frustrations, which contributed to his theatrics, and he promised to change for the better.[390]

Despite being the all-time top goalscorer for Brazil, Neymar is criticised by the media for not fulfilling the expectations set for him at the beginning of his career: winning the Ballon d'Or and leading Brazil to a World Cup win.[392] According to Sports Illustrated, Neymar could end his career as the best player never to win a Ballon d'Or or World Cup.[393] Neymar finished in third place in the 2015 and 2017 editions of the Ballon d'Or, both times behind Messi and Ronaldo.

At PSG, Neymar was also expected to lead them to their first-ever Champions League title; the club lost to Bayern Munich in the 2020 final.[392] His injury struggles at PSG hindered his playing time and his explosiveness. The injuries contributed to him not achieving more in his prime years, as he cumulatively missed 119 matches[222] and only played over 30 games (in a single season) once for PSG.[394][395] In 2023, Spanish publication Marca wrote that ""Neymar's star is dimming due to a seemingly endless string of injuries"".[396]

Neymar was also criticised for his lack of professional discipline, with his desire to party and play late-night poker games. In 2018, Pelé criticised Neymar: ""It's difficult to defend Neymar for all the things he does besides playing football. I've been with him in Europe twice. We talked and I explained: 'The God of football gave you the gift. What you do complicates it'.""[140] In February 2023, the day after PSG lost to Bayern Munich in the first leg of the Champions League Round of 16, images of Neymar in a fast-food restaurant surfaced on social media. Neymar defended himself, saying ""It's my life, I do what I want.""[222]

In 2023, following his departure from Europe to Saudi Arabia at a young age (31), various media outlets dubbed Neymar as the 'Prince who never became King'.[232][233] Westwood of Goal cited Neymar's move to PSG as the reason for him not being regarded as a ""true legend of the game"".[140] RMC Sport journalist Daniel Riolo said: ""Do we realise that Neymar, in terms of transfer and salary, is the biggest failure in the history of football? I can't think of a bigger failure for what he cost, it's horrible.""[397]

On the contrary, Cox of The Athletic argues that Neymar deserves to be regarded as one of football's all-time greats in light of becoming Brazil's all-time topscorer.[398] Tom Hindle of Goal credits Neymar as among the most talented players ever, also claiming that he had the potential to be a ""top five player"" of all time.[399] Brazil coach Fernando Diniz declared that Neymar is one of the greatest players in history.[400] Lawrence Ostlere of The Independent opinionated that Messi was the only player superior in ""every facet of the game"" than Neymar during his 10-year tenure in Europe.[401]

The media have often drawn comparisons between Neymar and Brazilian legend Pelé,[366] as Neymar possesses similar attributes to that of Pelé, and they both came from the Santos Youth Academy. In February 2013, he was on the cover of Time magazine with the title 'The Next Pelé'.[402] Neymar has said that Pelé is his ""role model"" but also said: ""I don't like to make a comparison with Pelé"".[403]

During his prime years, Neymar has frequently been compared to his Barcelona teammate Lionel Messi, by which Neymar has commented on saying: ""Messi is above everyone, there is no use comparing me with him. He is the best player in the world and I always get inspired when I watch good football.""[404] Ronaldo stated: ""Neymar is a great talent, the best we have in Brazil. He is very similar to Messi."" Zico said: ""I see Neymar like a [Cristiano] Ronaldo or a Messi, the type who appears and makes things happen.""[405] After his hat-trick in a 3–1 victory against Internacional in the Copa Libertadores and Messi's five goals scored in the Champions League, Neymar said: ""I am a Messi fan. I was told what he did today. I support him to score a lot of nice goals so I can keep copying and imitating him.""[406][407]

Described as a 'hair icon' in sports by GQ Australia, Neymar has a reputation for flamboyant hairstyles.[408]

Neymar has a very close sibling relationship with his sister Rafaella Beckran. He honoured Beckran by tattooing her face on his arm while she tattooed her brother's eyes on her arm.[409] Neymar is the father to one son and two daughters, each with a different woman.[410] In December 2024, he announced he is expecting his fourth child; a second daughter with the mother of his second child.[411]

Neymar is a Christian[12][13] and follows the Pentecostal branch of the religion.[412] Neymar has said about his faith: ""Life only makes sense when our highest ideal is to serve Christ!""[413] Additionally, he has worn a headband with the words ""100% Jesus"".[414] Neymar also tithes some of his income to his church and has named Kaká as his religious role model.[415] Each year, Neymar organises a charity match with fellow Brazilian footballer Nenê in Nenê's hometown of Jundiaí, with the purpose of raising food for needy families.[416] In addition to his native Portuguese, Neymar also speaks Spanish.[417][418]

In July 2019, police announced that a rape investigation against Neymar would be dropped due to insufficient evidence.[419] On 2 September 2020, it was reported that Neymar, along with PSG teammates Ángel Di María and Leandro Paredes, tested positive for COVID-19. The French sports newspaper L'Équipe said that the three players reportedly went on vacation in Ibiza. As a result, they were quarantined for one week, and the rest of the players and working staff were scheduled to take a coronavirus test within the same week.[420][421]

During a match between Paris Saint-Germain and Marseille, Neymar reported being racially abused by Álvaro González, after being sent off for hitting González in the back of the head.[423] The Spanish defender denied making any racist comments towards Neymar.[424] On 16 September, Neymar was handed a two-match ban for his actions; Ligue 1 also began an investigation into the alleged racist comments made by Álvaro.[425] Several days before the decision made by the French league, Spanish radio station Cadena SER claimed to have footage of Neymar racially abusing OM player Hiroki Sakai.[426] On 30 September, Ligue 1 decided that both Álvaro and Neymar would receive no suspensions as there was insufficient evidence of their wrongdoings.[427] Additionally, Sakai denied any racist comments from Neymar on social media.[428]

Neymar supported Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro in the 2022 Brazilian general election.[422]

In the summer of 2023, Agence France-Presse, citing local authorities, reported that Neymar faced a potential fine of about $1 million for environmental violations committed during the construction of his Mangaratiba mansion. The unauthorised diversion of the waterway, the use of beach sand without permission, and the unauthorised earthworks were mentioned in the report.[429]

Neymar has signed many sponsorships since his reputation began to grow from the age of 17. In March 2011, he signed an 11-year contract with American sportswear company Nike,[430] which ended in August 2020 after a Nike employee made a sexual assault complaint against him.[431][432] Since then, Neymar has signed with German sportswear company Puma.[433] In March 2011, Panasonic paid US$2.4 million to secure Neymar's services for two years. In 2012, France Football had ranked Neymar 13th in its list of the world's richest players, with total earnings of $18.8 million for the previous 12 months.[434] He has also signed other sponsorships from Volkswagen, Tenys Pé Baruel, Lupo, Ambev, Claro, Unilever, and Santander.[435][436][437][438]

In 2018, France Football ranked Neymar the third-highest-paid footballer in the world, earning a total income for €81.5m ($95m) for the year.[439] In 2019, Forbes ranked Neymar the world's third-highest-paid athlete (after Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo) with earnings of $105 million for the year.[440]

On 8 May 2013, Neymar was named by SportsPro magazine as the most marketable athlete in the world, ahead of Lionel Messi (2nd) and Cristiano Ronaldo (8th).[441] The same month, Neymar launched the Nike Hypervenom football boot.[442] In November 2012, advertising agency Loducca created Neymar's own personal brand logo,[443] featuring the N, J, and R (Neymar Junior) with the N styled to match Neymar's shirt number 11.[443] Neymar starred in a 2014 advert for Beats alongside other football stars such as Thierry Henry and Luis Suárez, with the theme of 'The Game Before The Game' and the players pre-game ritual of listening to music.[444]

In the later stages of his career, Neymar has been regularly seen playing high limit poker, including live streamed celebrity games from California's Hustler Casino.[445][446] In 2025, boxer Conor Benn called out his rival boxer Chris Eubank Jr. at a pre-fight press conference, alleging Eubank Jr. owed Neymar £4 million in poker debts.[447]

Neymar was featured on the front covers of the video games Pro Evolution Soccer 2012 and Pro Evolution Soccer 2013 on the North American version, after Konami Digital Entertainment announced that he had joined Pro Evolution Soccer.[448] Neymar joined Cristiano Ronaldo as a featured cover athlete.[449][450] Neymar also features in EA Sports' FIFA video game series, with the trailer for FIFA 18 showing him in his PSG home jersey.[451] He appeared alongside Cristiano Ronaldo on the Champions and Ultimate Edition packs for FIFA 19, where Neymar's ""Hang Loose"" goal celebration also features in the game.[452][453] Neymar also appears as a playable operator in the 2022 first-person shooter Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II alongside fellow football players Paul Pogba and Lionel Messi,[454] whose character models were released as downloadable content to coincide with the 2022 FIFA World Cup.[455]

Neymar appeared on the cover of Time magazine in February 2013, the first Brazilian athlete to do so. The issue included an article by Bobby Ghosh entitled ""The Next Pelé"" and subtitled ""How the career of Brazilian football star Neymar explains his country's economy"".[456]

Controversy erupted because of a cover by Brazilian football magazine Placar that depicted Neymar on a cross. The title read ""A Crucificação de Neymar"" (the Crucifixion of Neymar) and subtitled: ""the Brazilian ace turns scapegoat in a sport where everyone plays dirty"".[457]

In April 2013, Brazilian cartoonist Mauricio de Sousa released a Monica's Gang comic book featuring a younger version of Neymar (called Neymar Jr.) as the main character.[458]

In May 2013, SportsPro magazine named Neymar as the most marketable athlete on the planet for the second consecutive year. He topped the list ahead of Lionel Messi, Rory McIlroy, Usain Bolt and Cristiano Ronaldo, among other sportspeople.[459] The list measures the monetary value, the age, the force in domestic markets, the charisma and their market potential in the next three years.[459] In March 2015, Neymar had the fourth highest social media rank in the world among sportspeople, behind Cristiano Ronaldo, Lionel Messi and David Beckham, with 52 million Facebook fans.[460][461] He has over 200 million Instagram followers, the third highest for a sportsperson (after Cristiano Ronaldo and Messi), and inside the top 20 most followed people.[462] In ESPN's list of active sportspeople in 2016, Neymar was ranked the fourth most famous athlete in the world.[463] In April 2017, Neymar was included in the Time 100, Time magazine's list of the most influential people in the world.[464] In 2019, ESPN again ranked him the world's fourth most famous athlete.[465]

To mark the World Cup commencing in Brazil, in June 2014, Neymar appeared with supermodel Gisele Bündchen on the front cover of Vogue's Brazilian edition.[466] In November 2014, Neymar appeared in FIFA's ""11 against Ebola"" campaign with a selection of top football players from around the world, including Cristiano Ronaldo, Gareth Bale, Xavi and Didier Drogba.[467] Under the slogan ""Together, we can beat Ebola"", FIFA's campaign was done in conjunction with the Confederation of African Football and health experts, with the players holding up eleven messages to raise awareness of the disease and ways to combat it.[467][468]

In collaboration with DAZN, in 2019 Neymar appeared in The Making Of series, documentaries which relives the significant games that helped define football's greatest modern icons, with Neymar recounting his performance for Santos against Flamengo in 2011 when he scored that year's FIFA Puskás Award for Goal of the Year,[469] and also the film Neymar and the Line of King which covers Neymar's journey in becoming one of Brazil's top players.[470][471]

In December 2021, he signed a deal with Facebook Gaming.[472] He was also the subject of a 2022 Netflix documentary series titled Neymar: The Perfect Chaos.[473]

In the days leading up to the 2022 Brazilian presidential election, Neymar appeared in a TikTok video where he lip-synced a campaign jingle promoting the country's right-wing and socially conservative President Jair Bolsonaro.[474][475] He received heavy criticism for his endorsement.[476] Bolsonaro was defeated in the election by Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva.

Neymar has become an icon in promoting Brazilian modern pop music, particularly Música sertaneja. The video in which Neymar dances in the Santos locker room dancing in front of teammates carrying his recorder making the round of the players and making them react to the tune of Michel Teló's hit ""Ai se eu te pego!"" went viral. He made a point of performing his dance antics to the song after scoring goals in football games and appeared live with Teló in one of the latter's concerts. He also supported sertanejo singer Gusttavo Lima performing live with Lima on renditions of the singer's hits ""Balada"" and ""Fazer Beber"".

"
Lionel Messi,"Lionel Andrés ""Leo"" Messi[note 1] (Spanish pronunciation: [ljoˈnel anˈdɾes ˈmesi] ⓘ; born 24 June 1987) is an Argentine professional footballer who plays as a forward for and captains both Major League Soccer club Inter Miami and the Argentina national team. Widely regarded as one of the greatest players of all time, Messi set numerous records for individual accolades won throughout his professional footballing career such as eight Ballon d'Or awards and four the Best FIFA Men's Player awards (formerly the FIFA World Player of the Year).[note 2] He is the most decorated player in the history of professional football having won 45 team trophies,[note 3] including twelve Big Five league titles, four UEFA Champions Leagues, two Copa Américas, and one FIFA World Cup. Messi holds the records for most European Golden Shoes (6), most goals in a calendar year (91), most goals for a single club (672, with Barcelona), most goals (474), hat-tricks (36) and assists (192) in La Liga, most assists (18) and goal contributions (32) in the Copa América, most goal contributions (21) in the World Cup, most international appearances (191) and international goals (112) by a South American male, and the second-most in the latter category outright. A prolific goalscorer and creative playmaker, Messi has scored over 850 senior career goals and has provided over 380 assists for club and country.[21]

Born in Rosario, Argentina, Messi relocated to Spain to join Barcelona at age 13, and made his competitive debut at age 17 in October 2004. He gradually established himself as an integral player for the club, and during his first uninterrupted season at age 22 in 2008–09 he helped Barcelona achieve the first treble in Spanish football. This resulted in Messi winning the first of four consecutive Ballons d'Or, and by the 2011–12 season he would set La Liga and European records for most goals in a season and establish himself as Barcelona's all-time top scorer. The following two seasons, he finished second for the Ballon d'Or behind Cristiano Ronaldo, his perceived career rival. However, he regained his best form during the 2014–15 campaign, where he became the all-time top scorer in La Liga, led Barcelona to a historic second treble, and won a fifth Ballon d'Or in 2015. He assumed Barcelona's captaincy in 2018 and won a record sixth Ballon d'Or in 2019. During his overall tenure at Barcelona, Messi won a club-record 34 trophies, including ten La Liga titles and four Champions Leagues, among others. Financial difficulties at Barcelona led to Messi signing with French club Paris Saint-Germain in August 2021, where he would win the Ligue 1 title during both of his seasons there. He joined Major League Soccer club Inter Miami in July 2023.

An Argentine international, Messi is the national team's all-time leading goalscorer and most-capped player. His style of play as a diminutive, left-footed dribbler drew career-long comparisons with compatriot Diego Maradona, who described Messi as his successor. At the youth level, he won the 2005 FIFA World Youth Championship and gold medal in the 2008 Summer Olympics. After his senior debut in 2005, Messi became the youngest Argentine to play and score in a World Cup in 2006. Assuming captaincy in 2011, he then led Argentina to three consecutive finals in the 2014 FIFA World Cup, the 2015 Copa América and the Copa América Centenario, all of which they would lose. After initially announcing his international retirement in 2016, he returned to help his country narrowly qualify for the 2018 FIFA World Cup, which they would exit early. Messi and the national team finally broke Argentina's 28-year trophy drought by winning the 2021 Copa América, which helped him secure his seventh Ballon d'Or that year. He then led Argentina to win the 2022 Finalissima, as well as the 2022 FIFA World Cup, his country's third overall world championship and first in 36 years. This followed with a record-extending eighth Ballon d'Or in 2023, and a victory in the 2024 Copa América.

Messi has endorsed sportswear company Adidas since 2006. According to France Football, he was the world's highest-paid footballer for five years out of six between 2009 and 2014, and was ranked the world's highest-paid athlete by Forbes in 2019 and 2022. Messi was among Time's 100 most influential people in the world in 2011, 2012, and 2023. In 2020 and 2023, he was named the Laureus World Sportsman of the Year, the first team-sport athlete to win it. In 2020, Messi was named to the Ballon d'Or Dream Team and became the second footballer and second team-sport athlete to surpass $1 billion in career earnings. Following his arrival and impact on football in the US, Messi was named Time's Athlete of the Year in 2023, and in the following year was bestowed with the Presidential Medal of Freedom by decision of the president of the United States.

Messi was born on 24 June 1987 in Rosario, Santa Fe Province,[22] the third of four children of Jorge Messi, a steel factory manager, and his wife Celia Cuccittini, who worked in a magnet manufacturing workshop. On his father's side, he is of Italian and Spanish descent, the great-grandson of immigrants from the north-central Adriatic Marche region of Italy, and on his mother's side, he has primarily Italian ancestry.[3] Growing up in a tight-knit, football-loving family, ""Leo"" developed a passion for the sport from an early age, playing constantly with his older brothers, Rodrigo and Matías, and his cousins, Maximiliano and Emanuel Biancucchi, both of whom became professional footballers.[23] At the age of four he joined local club Grandoli, where he was coached by his father, though his earliest influence as a player came from his maternal grandmother, Celia, who accompanied him to training and matches.[24] He was greatly affected by her death, shortly before his eleventh birthday; since then, as a devout Catholic, he has celebrated his goals by looking up and pointing to the sky in tribute to his grandmother.[25][26]

""When you saw him you would think: this kid can't play ball. He's a dwarf, he's too fragile, too small. But immediately you'd realise that he was born different, that he was a phenomenon and that he was going to be something impressive.""

A lifelong supporter of Newell's Old Boys, Messi joined the Rosario club when he was seven years old. During the six years he played for Newell's, he scored almost 500 goals as a member of ""The Machine of '87"", the near-unbeatable youth side named for the year of their birth, and regularly entertained crowds by performing ball tricks during half-time of the first team's home games.[28][29][30] His goalscoring idol growing up was Brazilian striker Ronaldo, with Messi calling him ""the best forward I've ever seen"".[31]

However, his future as a professional player was threatened when, aged 10, he was diagnosed with a growth hormone deficiency. As his father's health insurance covered only two years of growth hormone therapy, which cost at least $1,000 per month, Newell's agreed to contribute, but later reneged on their promise.[32] He was scouted by Buenos Aires club River Plate, whose playmaker Pablo Aimar he idolised.[33][34] It was speculated that he failed to sign with River Plate due to his ill health; however, in a 2019 interview, Messi revealed that River Plate had offered to pay for his medical treatment after he scored four goals at a trial. River wanted to sign him, but Newell's Old Boys, who had refused to pay for his treatment, also refused to release his player card, preventing the transfer.[35]

As the Messi family had relatives in Catalonia, they sought to arrange a trial with Barcelona in September 2000. First-team director Charly Rexach immediately wanted to sign him, but the board of directors hesitated; at the time it was highly unusual for European clubs to sign foreign players of such a young age. On 14 December, an ultimatum was issued for Barcelona to prove their commitment, and Rexach, with no other paper at hand, offered a contract on a paper napkin.[33][36] In February 2001, the family relocated to Barcelona, where they moved into an apartment near the club's stadium, Camp Nou. During his first year in Spain, Messi rarely played with the Infantiles due to a transfer conflict with Newell's; as a foreigner, he could only be fielded in friendlies and the Catalan league. Without football, he struggled to integrate into the team; already reserved by nature, he was so quiet that his teammates initially believed he was mute. At home, he suffered from homesickness after his mother moved back to Rosario with his brothers and little sister, María Sol, while he stayed in Barcelona with his father.[28][36][37]

After a year at Barcelona's youth academy, La Masia, Messi was finally enrolled in the Royal Spanish Football Federation (RFEF) in February 2002. Now playing in all competitions, he befriended his teammates, among whom were Cesc Fàbregas and Gerard Piqué.[38] After completing his growth hormone therapy aged 14,[39] Messi became an integral part of the ""Baby Dream Team"", Barcelona's greatest-ever youth side. During his first full season (2002–03), he was top scorer with 36 goals in 30 games for the Cadetes A, who won an unprecedented treble of the league and both the Spanish and Catalan cups.[38][40] The Copa Catalunya final, a 4–1 victory over Espanyol, became known in club lore as the partido de la máscara, the final of the mask. A week after suffering a broken cheekbone during a league match, Messi was allowed to start the game on the condition that he wear a plastic protector; soon hindered by the mask, he took it off and scored two goals in 10 minutes before his substitution.[41] At the close of the season, he received an offer to join Arsenal, his first from a foreign club, but while Fàbregas and Piqué soon left for England, he chose to remain in Barcelona.[36][42][43]

Messi continued to progress through the club's ranks at a rapid pace, debuting for four youth teams during the 2003–04 season.[44] After being named player of the tournament in four international pre-season competitions with the Juvenil B, he played only one official match with the team before being promoted to the Juvenil A, where he scored 18 goals in 11 league games.[45][46] Messi was then one of several youth players called up to strengthen a depleted first team during the international break. French winger Ludovic Giuly explained how Messi caught the eye in a training session with Frank Rijkaard's first team: ""He destroyed us all... They were kicking him all over the place to avoid being ridiculed by this kid, he just got up and kept on playing. He would dribble past four players and score a goal. Even the team's starting centre-backs were nervous. He was an alien.""[47]

""It seemed as if he had been playing with us all his life.""

At 16 years, four months, and 23 days old, Messi made his first-team debut when he came on in the 75th minute during a friendly against José Mourinho's Porto on 16 November 2003.[36][49] His performance, creating two chances and a shot on goal, impressed the technical staff, and he subsequently began training daily with the club's reserve side, Barcelona B, as well as weekly with the first team.[50] After his first training session with the senior squad, Barça's new star player, Ronaldinho, told his teammates that he believed the 16-year-old would become an even better player than himself.[51] Ronaldinho soon befriended Messi, whom he called ""little brother"", which greatly eased his transition into the first team.[52][53]

To gain further match experience, Messi joined Barcelona C in addition to the Juvenil A, playing his first game for the third team on 29 November. He helped save them from the relegation zone of the Tercera División, scoring five goals in ten games, including a hat-trick in eight minutes during a Copa del Rey match while man-marked by Sevilla's Sergio Ramos.[45][54] His progress was reflected in his first professional contract, signed on 4 February 2004, which lasted until 2012 and contained an initial buyout clause of €30 million. A month later, on 6 March, he made his debut for Barcelona B in the Segunda División B, and his buyout clause automatically increased to €80 million.[45][55] He played five games with the B team that season but did not score.[56] Physically he was weaker than his opponents, who were often much older and taller, and in training he worked on increasing his muscle mass and overall strength in order to be able to shake off defenders. Towards the end of the season, he returned to both youth teams, helping the Juvenil B win the league. He finished the campaign having scored for four of his five teams with a total of 36 goals in all official competitions.[45][54]

Messi began the 2004–05 season as a guaranteed starter for the Barcelona B team, but after some lobbying by the senior players, he was promoted to the first team by manager Frank Rijkaard.[51] He made his La Liga debut for Barcelona on 16 October 2004 against Espanyol,[36] and scored his first senior goal on 1 May 2005 against Albacete, from an assist by Ronaldinho, becoming at that time the youngest-ever scorer for the club.[57][58] At 17 years, three months, and 22 days old, he was at the time the youngest player to represent Barcelona in an official competition, and the club won the league title during that season.[53][59]

On his 18th birthday, he signed his first contract as a senior team player, which was updated three months later to keep him at the club until 2014.[55][60] Barcelona began the 2005–06 season by winning the Supercopa de España without Messi, who was not selected to participate in the competition.[19] By the end of the season, the team won La Liga again as well as the UEFA Champions League, although Messi did not play in the final for the latter due to injury.[61][62]

During the 2006–07 season, Messi scored his first hat-trick in a Clásico against Real Madrid, the first player to do so in 12 years.[63] An incredibly finesse goal from Messi against Getafe and another goal scored by a handball against Espanyol gained notice for their similarities to the two famous goals scored by fellow Argentine Diego Maradona in the 1986 World Cup match against England, drawing comparisons between the two that Messi would face throughout his career.[64][65][66] The team finished the season with only one trophy – the 2006 Supercopa de España. Barcelona finished the next 2007–08 season trophyless, leading to Rijkaard's departure.[67]

At the beginning of the 2008–09 season, his first under Barcelona's new manager, former captain Pep Guardiola, Messi was given the number 10 shirt.[68] Over time, he effectively became the tactical focal point of Guardiola's possession-based system, increasing his goalscoring rate as a result.[69] During that season, Messi scored 38 total goals, and alongside Samuel Eto'o and Thierry Henry, contributed to a total of 100 goals in all competitions, a record at the time for the club.[70][71] Messi played as a false nine for the first time in a Clásico against Real Madrid, setting up his side's first goal and scoring twice in the team's greatest-ever score at Santiago Bernabéu Stadium.[72][73] He played his first final, winning the Copa del Rey.[74] In addition, Barcelona won the La Liga title and later won the Champions League, thus achieving the first treble in the history of Spanish football.[75]

During the first half of the 2009–10 season, Barcelona would also win the Supercopa de España, UEFA Super Cup and FIFA Club World Cup, resulting in becoming the first club to achieve the sextuple.[76][77] Messi finished as the Champions League top scorer, the youngest in the tournament's history.[78] For his efforts in 2009, Messi won the Ballon d'Or and the FIFA World Player of the Year award.[79] Messi scored a total of 47 goals in all competitions, equaling Ronaldo's club record from the 1996–97 campaign.[80][81] He finished the season as top scorer in the Champions League,[82] and La Liga, winning his second consecutive league trophy and earned his first European Golden Shoe.[81][83]

In the 2010–11 campaign, Messi won the Supercopa de España,[84] Champions League,[85] and a third consecutive La Liga title. His club performances in 2010 earned him his second consecutive Ballon d'Or.[86] Messi was the top scorer in the Champions League, for the third consecutive year,[87] and the league's top scorer and assist provider.[88][89] He became Barcelona's all-time single-season top scorer with 53 goals.[88][90]

""I feel sorry for those who want to compete for Messi's throne – it's impossible, this kid is unique.""

Messi began the 2011–12 season winning both the Spanish and European Super Cups trophies.[92][93] At the close of the year, he won the FIFA Club World Cup and earned the Golden Ball for a second time.[94] For his efforts in 2011, he received the FIFA Ballon d'Or, becoming only the fourth player in history to win the Ballon d'Or three times,[95] and the inaugural UEFA Best Player in Europe Award.[96] During the year 2012, Messi became the second player to be top scorer in four Champions League campaigns.[97][98] Messi became the top goalscorer in Barcelona's history at 24 years old, overtaking the 57-year record of César Rodríguez's 232 goals with a hat-trick against Granada.[99] He finished the season as league top scorer in Spain and Europe for a second time, with 50 goals, a La Liga record, while his 73 goals in all competitions made him the single-season top scorer in the history of European club football excluding regional and local competitions.[100][101] The team would also win the Copa del Rey that season, their 14th trophy under Guardiola, who resigned following the season after a four-year cycle of success.[102]

For the start of the 2012–13 season, Barcelona had virtually secured their La Liga title by the start of 2013.[103] A double scored against Real Betis saw Messi becoming Barcelona's all-time top scorer in La Liga, and surpassed Gerd Müller's record of most goals scored in a calendar year; Messi would score a record 91 goals in all competitions for Barcelona and Argentina throughout 2012.[104][105] Messi again won the FIFA Ballon d'Or, becoming the first player in history to win the Ballon d'Or four times.[105][106] He signed a new contract committing himself to the club through 2018, and wore the captain's armband for the first time in a league match against Rayo Vallecano.[107][108][109] The team would win La Liga again that year, Messi's sixth, equalling Real Madrid's 100-point record of the previous season. With 60 goals in all competitions, including 46 goals in La Liga, he finished the campaign as league top scorer in Spain and Europe for the second consecutive year, becoming the first player in history to win the European Golden Shoe three times.[110]

Messi's overall input into the team's attack had increased significantly. Whereas he contributed to 24% of the team's goals in their treble-winning campaign, this number rose to more than 40% by the end of the 2012–13 season.[111] These statistics, as well as lopsided losses in the Champions League where Messi was unfit, gave credence to the notion of Messidependencia, Barcelona's perceived tactical and psychological dependence on their star player.[112]

To offset the load on Messi, Barcelona would sign Brazilian forward Neymar from Santos before the 2013–14 season.[113] The team would win the Supercopa de España at the beginning of the season.[114] Messi finished the campaign with his worst output in five seasons, though he still managed to score 41 goals in all competitions.[115] For the first time in five years, Barcelona ended the season without a major trophy.[116]

Barcelona hired coach Luis Enrique before the 2014–15 season, and would continue to aid Messi in the attack by signing Uruguayan forward Luis Suárez, who had won the European Golden Shoe the year before at Liverpool.[117][118] Luis Enrique's system would feature quick transitions from defense to attack, led by the front three of Messi, Suárez and Neymar. The attacking trio, which colloquially became known as 'MSN', would break goalscoring records.[119] A hat-trick scored against Sevilla earlier in the season would also make him the all-time top scorer in La Liga, as he surpassed the 59-year record of 251 league goals held by Telmo Zarra.[120] After securing the La Liga title, the Copa del Rey, and the Champions League that year, Messi helped Barcelona become the first club to win the continental treble twice.[121][122] He would record 58 goals, but combined with Neymar and Suárez, the attacking trio scored a total of 122 goals in all competitions that season, a record in Spanish football.[123]

Messi opened the 2015–16 season by helping Barcelona's win over Sevilla in the UEFA Super Cup.[124] Messi capped off the year by winning the 2015 FIFA Club World Cup final over River Plate in Yokohama, collecting his fifth club trophy of the calendar year.[125] On 11 January 2016, Messi won the FIFA Ballon d'Or for a record fifth time in his career.[126] He would end the season by winning La Liga as well as the Copa del Rey again.[127] In total, Messi scored 41 goals, and Barcelona's attacking trio of him, Neymar and Suárez managed a Spanish record of 131 combined goals throughout the season, breaking the record they had set the previous season.[128]

The 2016–17 season would end with Messi winning the Supercopa de España and the Copa del Rey.[129][130] He would finish the season with 54 goals, while his 37 goals in La Liga saw him claim both the Pichichi and European Golden Boot Awards for the fourth time in his career.[131] Messi, Neymar and Suárez would combine for 110 goals by season's end. Neymar would depart for Paris Saint Germain the next year, leaving the attacking trio with a combined total of 363 goals over the course of three seasons.[132] Luis Enrique would also leave Barcelona at the end of the season after managing the club to a total of nine trophies during his three-year tenure.[133]

Messi would sign a new deal with Barcelona on 25 November 2017, keeping him with the club through 2021.[134] The 2017–18 season saw Messi achieving the domestic double, winning La Liga and the Copa del Rey once again.[135] He once again finished the season as the top scorer in La Liga, with 34 goals, which also saw him win his fifth European Golden Shoe award.[136] With the departure of former captain Andrés Iniesta in May 2018, Messi was named the team's new captain for the 2018–19 season.[137] He lifted his first trophy as Barcelona's captain, the Supercopa de España, following a 2–1 victory over Sevilla. He helped Barcelona clinch the La Liga title, his tenth but first as captain.[138] With 36 goals in 34 appearances that season, he won his sixth league Golden Boot trophy, equalling Zarra as the player with the most top-scorer awards in La Liga.[139][140] He also captured his sixth Golden Shoe award, and a record third consecutive award since the 2016–17 season.[141]

Messi would win his sixth Ballon d'Or, but the subsequent 2019–20 season saw Barcelona go trophyless for the first time since 2007–08.[142] Following a disappointing season, Barcelona announced that Messi sent the club ""a document expressing his desire to leave"", but Messi ultimately decided to fulfill the final year of his contract.[143][144] The 2020–21 season saw Messi surpass Xavi's record to reach a club record of 768 appearances.[145] He would lead the club to victory in the 2021 Copa del Rey final.[146][147] His last two seasons with Barcelona saw him lead La Liga in goal scoring, giving him a record-breaking total of eight Pichichi trophies.[148][149]

Messi became a free agent after his contract expired, with negotiations on a new deal complicated due to Barcelona's financial issues.[150][151] Barcelona would eventually announce that Messi would not be staying at the club, citing financial and structural obstacles posed by La Liga regulations as a reason for Messi's departure.[152][153] In a tearful press conference held at the Camp Nou, Messi confirmed that he would be leaving Barcelona.[154]

On 10 August 2021, Messi joined Ligue 1 club Paris Saint-Germain (PSG), reuniting him with Neymar, for the 2021–22 season on a two-year deal until June 2023 with an option for an extra year.[155][156] Messi chose 30 as his squad number, the same he wore as a teenager when he made his senior debut for Barcelona.[157] He would make his debut with the club against Reims, made his first start and Champions League debut for the club against Club Brugge, and made his home debut in a match against Lyon[158][159][160] He scored his first goal for the club in a Champions League group stage win over former manager Pep Guardiola's Manchester City.[161] Having scored 40 goals at club and international level for the calendar year in addition to captaining Argentina to the 2021 Copa América, Messi received a record seventh Ballon d'Or.[162] He finished his debut season with PSG with 11 goals and 14 assists across all competitions, helping the club win their 10th Ligue 1 title.[163]

Beginning the 2022–23 season, Messi would win his second trophy with PSG in the Trophée des Champions.[164] A goal against Nice resulted in him surpassing Cristiano Ronaldo as the all-time highest goalscorer in European club football with 702 goals; during the match, he also achieved 1,000 career direct goal contributions at club level.[165][166] By the end of the season, he had 21 goals across all competitors and the highest number of assists in the league with 16, which helped PSG clinch their 11th Ligue 1 title and his second in a row.[167][168][169] Following the last game of the season, manager Christophe Galtier confirmed that it would be Messi's last for PSG, with the club confirming his departure two days later.[170]

Major League Soccer (MLS) club Inter Miami CF announced the signing of Messi on a two-and-a-half-year contract on 15 July 2023.[171][172] Messi made his 2023 debut for the club in a Leagues Cup match against Cruz Azul, scoring with a free-kick in stoppage time for a victory.[173] After scoring nine goals in his first six games for Miami, Messi led the team to the club's first-ever trophy by winning the Leagues Cup against Nashville SC.[174] Messi made his MLS debut against the New York Red Bulls.[175] Miami would miss the playoffs, finish 14th in the Eastern Conference, having gone winless in their last seven games.[176] On 30 October 2023, following his World Cup win with Argentina and Ligue 1 trophy with PSG, Messi was awarded a record-extending eighth Ballon d'Or.[177] He was also named Time Athlete of the Year, the first footballer to ever win the award.[178]

During the 2024 season, Messi broke the record for the most assists in a single MLS game with five assists and he also broke the record for the most goal contributions in an MLS game with six in a 6–2 win over the New York Red Bulls.[179] On 2 October, Messi scored a brace in a 3–2 win over Columbus Crew, clinching the Supporters' Shield, his 46th trophy.[180] In the final game of the regular season on 19 October against the New England Revolution, Messi scored his first hat-trick for the club in a 6–2 victory. Inter Miami's victory over the Revolution also allowed the club to finish with 74 points throughout the regular season, a league record for MLS. He would finish the regular season with 20 goals and 16 assists in 19 matches.[181] In doing so, he became Inter Miami's all-time leading goalscorer.[182]

Miami made its first postseason appearance in the 2024 MLS Cup playoffs but were eliminated in the first round after losing two games against Atlanta United FC. Messi would have his first postseason goal in the third game, a 3–2 loss.[183] He would be named the MLS Most Valuable Player following the conclusion of the regular season.[184]

As a dual Argentine-Spanish national, Messi was eligible to play for the national team of both countries.[185] He debuted for Argentina in 2004 for Argentina's U20 team against Paraguay, and was subsequently included in the squad for the 2005 South American U-20 Championship, where they would finish third.[186] Messi would then lead the team to victory in the 2005 FIFA World Youth Championship, his first success with Argentina. Finishing the tournament with six goals and two assists, he would also win the Golden Ball.[187][188][189]

Messi would make his debut with the senior national team in 2005, at age 18, coming off the bench in a friendly against Hungary.[190] Messi would have his first start in 2006 against Peru, and would score his first international goal in a friendly against Croatia.[191][192] His World Cup debut came in the 2006 FIFA World Cup as a substitute in the 74th minute against Serbia and Montenegro, assisting one goal and scoring the final one in their victory. This made him the youngest player to represent and score for Argentina in the World Cup.[193] He would represent Argentina again for the 2007 Copa América, where they would ultimately lose in the final. Messi was named the best young player of the tournament, having scored two goals and provided one assist.[194] The 2008 Summer Olympics would mark another major achievement with his country, as he led Argentina's U23 team to claim the Olympic gold medal over Nigeria. Messi registered two goals and three assists throughout, and was singled out by FIFA as the stand-out player from the tournament's best team.[195]

With the international retirement of Juan Román Riquelme, Messi was given Argentina's number 10 shirt.[196] During a 2010 FIFA World Cup group stage match against Greece, where a majority of the starters rested due to a secured place in the knockout rounds, Messi would wear the captain's armband for the first time.[197] Argentina were ultimately eliminated in the quarterfinals against Germany during that tournament, but Messi was identified as one of the tournament's 10 best players due to his pace and creativity, despite failing to register a single goal and only having one assist.[198] Ahead of the 2011 Copa América, Argentina began building their team around Messi.[199] However, Messi would again be goalless during the tournament but had three assists. The team would ultimately lose to Uruguay in penalties during the quarter-finals.[200]

Following their unsuccessful performance, a 24-year-old Messi would be awarded the captaincy of the squad.[201] The next several years saw many frustrations for Messi due to his inability to lead Argentina to win an international trophy. During the 2014 FIFA World Cup, Messi and Argentina lost to Germany in the final, though Messi was awarded the Golden Ball as the best player of the tournament regardless due to his overall performance with four goals and an assist.[202][203] Argentina would lose to Chile on penalties in the 2015 Copa América final the next year. At the close of the tournament, Messi was reportedly selected to receive the Golden Ball award, having scored one goal and provided three assists, but he rejected the honour.[204] In the 2016 Copa América Centenario semi-final against the United States, a goal from Messi would put him ahead of Gabriel Batistuta as Argentina's all-time leading goalscorer in international matches.[205] However, Argentina would again fall to Chile on penalties in the final.[206] Messi would have five goals and four assists throughout the tournament.[207]

Losing three consecutive finals in three consecutive years caused Messi to retire from international football, but a nationwide campaign in Argentina helped convince him to reverse his decision.[206][208] He would return to the national team to lead them to the 2018 FIFA World Cup. Argentina were in jeopardy of missing the tournament on the last game of the qualifiers against Ecuador, but a hat-trick from Messi dramatically secured their entry.[209] They would go on to lose to France in the Round of 16 during the World Cup, with Messi having one goal and two assists in the tournament.[210] The next year, Messi would again represent Argentina in the 2019 Copa América, where he registered only a single goal and assist. They would lose to hosts Brazil in the semi-final but ended with a third-place finish after defeating Chile.[211] This victory would mark the beginning of a 36-game unbeaten streak that would last for over three years.[212]

Messi would finally end Argentina's 28-year trophy drought in the 2021 Copa América, as they had not won an international tournament since 1993.[213] During a group stage match against Bolivia, he surpassed Javier Mascherano to become Argentina's most-capped player.[214] Argentina defeated Brazil in the final, and Messi was named the player of the tournament having been directly involved in nine out of the 12 goals scored by Argentina, scoring four of them and assisting five.[213] He captained Argentina to win another international trophy in the 2022 Finalissima against UEFA Euro 2020 winners Italy, where he was named player of the match after providing two assists.[215] At the 2022 FIFA World Cup, Messi led Argentina to its first World Cup victory in 36 years, scoring twice in the final to defeat France.[216] Having scored seven goals and assisting three during the tournament, Messi would again win the Golden Ball, becoming the first player to win it twice.[217] His appearance in the final also set new records for the most appearances (26) and direct goal contributions (21 – 13 goals and 8 assists) at the World Cup.[218]

A hat-trick in a 2023 friendly against Curaçao saw Messi reach 100 international goals, the third player and the first South American in history to achieve this milestone.[219] Later that year, a goal against Peru resulted in Messi becoming the all-time top goalscorer in CONMEBOL World Cup qualifiers.[220] During the 2024 Copa América semi-final against Canada, Messi scored his first and only goal of the tournament which also made him the second-highest international goalscorer of all time.[221] Argentina eventually won the final against Colombia for their second consecutive Copa América title, with Messi contributing one goal and assist overall while also setting a new record for most appearances (39) at Copa América.[222]

Due to his short stature, Messi has a lower centre of gravity than taller players, which gives him greater agility, allowing him to change direction more quickly and evade opposing tackles;[223][224] this has led the Spanish media to dub him La Pulga Atómica (""The Atomic Flea"").[225][226][227] Despite being physically unimposing, he possesses significant upper-body strength, which, combined with his low centre of gravity and resulting balance, aids him in withstanding physical challenges from opponents; he has consequently been noted for his lack of diving in a sport rife with playacting.[28][224][228] His short, strong legs allow him to excel in short bursts of acceleration while his quick feet enable him to retain control of the ball when dribbling at speed.[229] His former Barcelona manager Pep Guardiola once stated, ""Messi is the only player that runs faster with the ball than he does without it.""[230] Although he has improved his ability with his weaker foot since his mid-20s, Messi is predominantly a left-footed player; with the outside of his left foot, he usually begins dribbling runs, while he uses the inside of his foot to finish and provide passes and assists.[231][232]

A prolific goalscorer, Messi is known for his finishing, positioning, quick reactions, and ability to make attacking runs to beat the defensive line. He also functions in a playmaking role, courtesy of his vision and range of passing.[233] He has often been described as a magician; a conjurer, creating goals and opportunities where seemingly none exist.[234][235][236] Moreover, he is an accurate free kick and penalty kick taker.[224][237] As of September 2023, Messi ranks fifth all time in goals scored from direct free kicks with 65,[238] the most among active players.[239] He also has a penchant for scoring from chips.[240]

Messi's pace and technical ability enable him to undertake individual dribbling runs towards goal, in particular during counterattacks, usually starting from the halfway line or the right side of the pitch.[228][237][241] He is widely considered to be one of the greatest dribblers of all time.[242][243] With regard to this ability, his former Argentina manager Diego Maradona has said of him, ""The ball stays glued to his foot; I've seen great players in my career, but I've never seen anyone with Messi's ball control.""[232] Beyond his individual qualities, he is also a well-rounded, hard-working team player, known for his creative combinations, in particular with former Barcelona midfielders Xavi and Andrés Iniesta.[223][224]

As his career advanced, and his athleticism and tendency to dribble diminished slightly with age, Messi began to dictate play in deeper areas of the pitch and developed into one of the best passers and playmakers in football history.[244][245][246] His work-rate off the ball and defensive responsibilities also decreased as his career progressed; by covering less ground on the pitch, and instead conserving his energy for short bursts of speed, he was able to improve his efficiency, movement, and positional play, and was also able to avoid muscular injuries, despite often playing a large number of matches throughout a particular season on a consistent basis. Indeed, while he was injury-prone in his early career, he was later able to improve his injury record by running less off the ball, and by adopting a stricter diet, training regime, and sleep schedule.[247]

Tactically, Messi plays in a free attacking role; a versatile player, he is capable of attacking on either wing or through the centre of the pitch. His favoured position in childhood was the playmaker behind two strikers, known as the enganche in Argentine football, but he began his career in Spain as a left-winger or left-sided forward.[248] Upon his first-team debut, he was moved onto the right wing by manager Frank Rijkaard; from this position, he could more easily cut through the defence into the middle of the pitch and curl shots on goal with his left foot, rather than predominantly cross balls for teammates.[230] Under Guardiola and subsequent managers, he most often played in a false nine role; positioned as a centre-forward or lone striker, he would roam the centre, often moving deep into midfield and drawing defenders with him, in order to create and exploit spaces for passes, other teammates' attacking runs off the ball, Messi's own dribbling runs, or combinations with Xavi and Iniesta.[37]

Under the stewardship of Luis Enrique, Messi initially returned to playing in the right-sided position that characterised much of his early career in the manager's 4–3–3 formation,[249][250] while he was increasingly deployed in a deeper, free playmaking role in later seasons.[251][252] Under manager Ernesto Valverde, Messi played in a variety of roles. While he occasionally continued to be deployed in a deeper role, from which he could make runs from behind into the box,[253] or even on the right wing[254] or as a false nine,[255][256] he was also used in a more offensive, central role in a 4–2–3–1,[252] or as a second striker in a 4–4–2 formation, where he was once again given the licence to drop deep, link-up with midfielders, orchestrate his team's attacking plays, and create chances for his attacking partner Luis Suárez.[257][258] With the Argentina national team, Messi has similarly played anywhere along the frontline. Under various managers, he has been employed on the right wing, as a false nine, as an out-and-out striker, in a supporting role alongside another forward, or in a deeper, free creative role as a classic number 10 playmaker or attacking midfielder behind the strikers.[259][260]

Messi is widely regarded as one of the two best players of his generation, alongside Portuguese forward Cristiano Ronaldo.[261] He is also considered one of the greatest footballers in the history of the sport.[262]

A prodigious talent as a teenager, Messi established himself among the world's best players before age 20.[263] Shortly after teammate Ronaldinho won the 2005 Ballon d'Or, he commented, ""I'm not even the best at Barça"" in reference to his 18-year-old protégé.[264] Four years later, after Messi won his first Ballon d'Or by a record margin,[79] the public debate regarding his qualities as a player moved beyond his status in contemporary football to the possibility that he was one of the greatest players in history.[24][228][265] An early proponent was his then-Barcelona manager Pep Guardiola, who, as early as August 2009, declared Messi to be the best player he had ever seen.[266] In the following years, this opinion gained greater acceptance among pundits, managers, former and current players.[90][267] By the end of Barça's second treble-winning season, the view of Messi as one of the greatest footballers of all time had become the apparent view among many fans and pundits in continental Europe.[268][269]

Messi would receive dismissals by critics throughout his career based on the fact that he had not won an international tournament at senior level with Argentina.[270][271][272] However, his subsequent victories in the 2021 Copa América and the 2022 FIFA World Cup resulted in him finally winning every top tier trophy at both the club and country levels, an achievement that many pundits felt cemented Messi's legacy.[262]

Among his contemporary peers, Messi is most often compared and contrasted with Cristiano Ronaldo, who many consider his career rival.[261] Both achieved numerous individual accolades, won dozens of trophies for both club and country, and are the two leading goal scorers in history. Although Messi has at times denied any rivalry,[273][274] they are widely believed to push one another in their aim to be the best player in the world.[275] Pundits have compared the ongoing rivalry to past sports rivalries like the Muhammad Ali–Joe Frazier rivalry in boxing, the Prost–Senna rivalry in motorsport, and the tennis rivalries between Federer–Nadal and Borg–McEnroe.[276]

Fans and pundits alike regularly argue the individual merits of both players.[275][277] Messi is lauded for his combination of dribbling, playmaking, passing and goalscoring, while Ronaldo has received praise for his exceptional speed and athleticism, goalscoring skills, and performance under pressure.[278][279] Beyond their playing styles, the debate also revolves around their differing physiques – Ronaldo is 1.87 m (6 ft 1+1⁄2 in) with a muscular build, compared to Messi's smaller size – and contrasting public personalities with Ronaldo's self-confidence and theatrics a foil to Messi's humility.[280] Regarding individual achievements, Messi has won eight Ballons d'Or to Ronaldo's five,[281] eight FIFA World's Best Player awards to Ronaldo's five, and six European Golden Shoes to Ronaldo's four.[282] Off the pitch, Ronaldo is his direct competitor in terms of salary, sponsorships, and social media fanbase.[283]

Messi's head-to-head record against teams that feature Ronaldo consists of 15 wins, 9 draws, and 10 losses in competitive club matches, one win and loss each in international friendlies, and one win in a club friendly. The first competitive matchup between the two occurred in 2008, when Ronaldo's Manchester United were drawn to play Messi's Barcelona in the 2007–08 UEFA Champions League semi-finals, where Ronaldo and Manchester United would eventually advance 1–0 on aggregate, and go on to win the final.[284] The two players and their teams would meet again in the next year's Champions League, this time in the final, with Messi and Barcelona emerging as the victors after a 2–0 result.[285] After this, Ronaldo would transfer to Real Madrid, the main rivals of Barcelona, and from 2009–10 to 2017–18, Messi faced Ronaldo at least twice every season in El Clásico, which ranks among the world's most viewed annual sports events.[286][283] Ronaldo's would then transfer to Juventus in the summer of 2018; their final matchup in a competitive match would occur during a 2020–21 UEFA Champions League group stage match, where Ronaldo's two goals from the penalty spot helped Juventus to a 3–0 victory against Messi's Barcelona.[287] After Ronaldo left Real Madrid for Juventus, Messi stated: ""I miss Cristiano. Although it was a bit difficult to see him win trophies, he gave La Liga prestige.""[288]

Following Messi leading Argentina to victory in the 2022 World Cup, a number of football critics, commentators, and players have opined that Messi settled the debate between the two players.[289][290]

""I have seen the player who will inherit my place in Argentinian football and his name is Messi.""

Throughout his career, Messi has been compared with his compatriot Diego Maradona, who was also considered the best player of his generation and one of greatest in the history of the sport.[292][293] This was due to their short statures, their similar playing styles as diminutive, left-footed playmakers, and the fact that they both came from Argentina.[294] Initially, Messi was merely one of many young Argentine players to receive the ""New Maradona"" moniker, but as his career progressed, Messi proved his similarity beyond all previous contenders, establishing himself as the best player Argentina had produced since Maradona.[34][295] Even when Messi was 18 years old, Maradona called him the best player in the world and hailed him as his successor.[291] Messi and Maradona would work together as player and manager for Argentina's national side from 2008 through the 2010 FIFA World Cup, the latter thoroughly impressed with the former's skills.[296] It was during this period that Messi was given Argentina's number 10 shirt that Maradona famously wore. Maradona gave Messi his blessing, telling him: ""the No 10 is yours. There's nobody better than you to wear it.""[196]

During the early and middle parts of his career, Messi was generally held in lesser esteem than Maradona in Argentine society. Part of this had to do with Messi's lack of tournament success and perceived uneven output with the national team during this period – Maradona had famously led Argentina to victory in the 1986 FIFA World Cup with a dominant overall performance, which set expectations for Messi to do the same.[270][292][297] Also unlike Maradona, Messi never played in the Argentine Primera División, therefore depriving his countrymen a chance to watch him develop and prove himself, and through no fault of his own would do this overseas in La Liga instead.[28][297] Argentines also identified more with the fiery, extroverted and controversial Maradona who came from the slums, character traits that they felt aligned with their national values, as opposed to the reserved, introverted and unassuming Messi who had a comparable unremarkable upbringing in Rosario.[272][297][298] Several pundits, footballing figures, and Maradona himself would point to this temperament to question Messi's leadership capabilities for the national team.[270][299][300] Furthermore, Messi's lack of outward passion for the Albiceleste shirt, early tendency not to sing the national anthem, and disinclination to emotional displays have in the past led to the false perception that he felt more Catalan rather than truly Argentine.[200][301] However, despite having lived in Barcelona since age 13, Messi rejected the option of representing Spain internationally, saying: ""Argentina is my country, my family, my way of expressing myself. I would change all my records to make the people in my country happy.""[302]

Football journalist Tim Vickery stated the perception of Messi among Argentines changed in 2019, with Messi making a conscious effort to become ""more one of the group, more Argentine"".[301] Other pundits noted that Messi had grown more assertive as a leader during the 2019 Copa América by becoming more vocal with his teammates both on and off the pitch, finally singing the national anthem with the team before matches, and speaking with journalists at length after matches, the latter of which he rarely did for Barcelona.[303] Following the 2022 World Cup win for Messi and Argentina, Vickery felt that Messi would now be held in the same esteem by his compatriots as Maradona.[301] Former footballer turned journalist Jorge Valdano said he saw a ""Maradonian"" edge to Messi's performances during the tournament, while compatriot Osvaldo Ardiles mentioned that Messi's provoking actions against the Netherlands side during the quarter-final were ""more of a Maradona reaction,"" further endearing Messi to his countrymen.[304][305] Messi himself later remarked that the World Cup victory ""won over all the people of Argentina. Today 95% or 100% of Argentines love me and that's a beautiful feeling.""[306]

Messi was among the Time 100, an annual list of the world's most influential people, in 2011, 2012 and 2023.[307][308][309] According to a 2014 survey in 15 international markets, Messi was familiar to 87% of respondents around the world, of whom 78% perceived him favourably, making him the second-most recognised player globally, behind Cristiano Ronaldo, and the most likable of all contemporary players.[310][311] World Press Photo selected ""The Final Game"", a photo of Messi facing the World Cup trophy after Argentina's final defeat to Germany, as the best sports image of 2014.[312] On his economic impact on the city in which he plays, Terry Gibson called him a ""tourist attraction"".[313]

His fanbase on Facebook is among the largest of public figures: within seven hours of its launch in April 2011, Messi's Facebook page had nearly seven million followers, and by July 2023 he had over 114 million followers, the second highest for a sportsperson after Ronaldo.[314][315] He has over 500 million Instagram followers, the second highest for an individual and sportsperson after Ronaldo.[316] His World Cup celebration post from 18 December 2022 is the most liked post on Instagram with over 75 million likes.[317]

On 20 March 2023, during a return to Buenos Aires following his World Cup victory, Messi was mobbed by hundreds of adoring fans when he and his family were out to dinner. When news spread where Messi and his family were, the restaurant was soon surrounded by locals hoping to get a glimpse of their World Cup-winning captain. Police assistance would be needed to get Messi back to his car in the early hours of the morning.[318] In April 2023, Messi was featured in the 200 year old Thrissur Pooram festival in Kerala, India.[319] During the festival, umbrellas carrying the illuminated cut outs of Messi holding the World Cup trophy were displayed on the top of caparisoned elephants during the Kudamattam ceremony.[320] In December 2023, a set of shirts Messi had worn during the 2022 World Cup was sold at auction for $7.8 million.[321]

During an exhibition match on 4 February 2024 in which Inter Miami faced off against the Hong Kong League players at Hong Kong Stadium, Messi would remain on the bench the entire game, causing massive backlash in Hong Kong and China as a result.[322] A Messi commercial was taken off air in those regions,[323] while others remained despite pressure from Chinese social-media users.[324][325][326] Furthermore, the Chinese Football Association temporarily halted its partnership with the Argentine Football Association over the incident on 8 February.[327]

Messi was the world's highest-paid footballer for five years out of six between 2009 and 2014; he was the first player to exceed the €40 million benchmark, with earnings of €41 million in 2013, and the €50–€60 million points, with income of €65 million in 2014.[328][329] Messi was second on Forbes list of the world's highest-paid athletes, after Cristiano Ronaldo, with income of $81 million from salary and endorsements in 2015–16.[330] In 2018 he was the first player to exceed the €100m benchmark for a calendar year, with earnings of €126m ($154m) in combined income from salaries, bonuses and endorsements.[331] Forbes ranked him the world's highest-paid athlete in 2019.[332] From 2008, he was Barcelona's highest-paid player, receiving a salary that increased incrementally from €7.8 million to €13 million over the next five years.[333][334][107] Signing a new contract in 2017, he earned $667,000 per week in wages, and Barcelona paid him $60 million as a signing on bonus.[335] His buyout clause was set at $835 million (€700 million).[335] In 2020, Messi became the second footballer, as well as the second athlete in a team sport, after Ronaldo, to surpass $1 billion in earnings during their careers.[336]

In addition to salary and bonuses, much of Messi's income derives from endorsements; SportsPro has consequently cited him as one of the world's most marketable athletes every year since their research began in 2010.[338] His main sponsor since 2006 is Adidas. As Barcelona's leading youth prospect, he was signed with Nike since age 14, but transferred to Adidas after they successfully challenged their rival's claim to his image rights in court.[339] Messi established himself as their leading brand endorser;[283] from 2008, he had a long-running signature collection of Adidas F50 boots, and in 2015, became the first footballer to receive his own sub-brand of Adidas boots, the Adidas Messi.[340][341] Since 2017, he has worn the latest version of the Adidas Nemeziz.[342] In 2015, a Barcelona jersey with Messi's name and number was the best-selling replica jersey worldwide.[343] At the 2022 World Cup, Adidas sold out Messi's No. 10 Argentina jersey worldwide.[337]

As a commercial entity, Messi's brand has been based exclusively on his talents and achievements as a player, in contrast to arguably more glamorous players like Ronaldo and David Beckham. At the start of his career, he thus mainly held sponsorship contracts with companies that employ sports-oriented marketing, such as Adidas, Pepsi, and Konami.[345][346] From 2010, concurrently with increased achievements as a player, his marketing appeal widened, leading to long-term endorsement deals with luxury brands Dolce & Gabbana and Audemars Piguet.[345][347] Messi is a global brand ambassador for Gillette, Turkish Airlines, Ooredoo, and Tata Motors, among other companies.[348][349][350][351] Messi was the face of Konami's video game series Pro Evolution Soccer, appearing on the covers of PES 2009, PES 2010, PES 2011 and PES 2020. He subsequently signed with rival company EA Sports to become the face of their series FIFA and appeared on consecutive covers from FIFA 13 to FIFA 16.[352][353]

In 2013, a Turkish Airlines advertisement starring Messi, in which he engages in a selfie competition with Kobe Bryant, was the most-watched ad on YouTube in 2013, receiving 137 million views, and was voted the best advertisement of the 2005–15 decade to commemorate YouTube's founding.[354][355] In June 2021, Messi signed a five-year deal to become an ambassador for the Hard Rock Cafe brand. He stated, ""sports and music are an integral part of my life. It is an honor to be the first athlete to partner with a brand who has a history of teaming with music legends.""[356]

In May 2022, Messi was unveiled as Saudi Arabia's tourism ambassador. Due to Saudi Arabia's poor human rights record, Messi was condemned for the role which was viewed as an attempt of Saudi sportswashing.[357][358]

Throughout his career, Messi has been involved in charitable efforts aimed at vulnerable children, a commitment that stems in part from the medical difficulties he faced in his own childhood. Since 2004, he has contributed his time and finances to the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), an organisation with which Barcelona also have a strong association.[359][360] Messi has served as a UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador since his appointment in March 2010, completing his first field mission for the organisation four months later as he travelled to Haiti to bring public awareness to the plight of the country's children in the wake of the 2010 Haiti earthquake. He has since participated in UNICEF campaigns targeting HIV prevention, education, and the social inclusion of disabled children.[361] To celebrate his son's first birthday, in November 2013, Messi and Thiago were part of a publicity campaign to raise awareness of mortality rates among disadvantaged children.[362]

In addition to his work with UNICEF, Messi founded his own charitable organisation, the Leo Messi Foundation, which supports access to health care, education, and sport for children.[363] It was established in 2007 following a visit Messi paid to a hospital for terminally ill children in Boston, an experience that resonated with him to the point that he decided to reinvest part of his earnings into society.[364] Through his foundation, Messi has awarded research grants, financed medical training, and invested in the development of medical centres and projects in Argentina, Spain, and elsewhere in the world.[364][365] In addition to his own fundraising activities, such as his global ""Messi and Friends"" football matches, his foundation receives financial support from various companies to which he has assigned his name in endorsement agreements, with Adidas as their main sponsor.[366][367] A gold replica of his left foot, weighing 25 kg (55 lb) and valued at $5.3 million, went on sale in Japan in 2013 to raise funds for victims of the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami.[368]

Messi has also invested in youth football in Argentina: he financially supports Sarmiento, a football club based in the Rosario neighbourhood where he was born, committing in 2013 to the refurbishment of their facilities and the installation of all-weather pitches, and funds the management of several youth players at Newell's Old Boys and rival club Rosario Central, as well as at River Plate and Boca Juniors in Buenos Aires.[364] At Newell's Old Boys, his boyhood club, he funded the 2012 construction of a new gymnasium and a dormitory inside the club's stadium for their youth academy. His former youth coach at Newell's, Ernesto Vecchio, is employed by the Leo Messi Foundation as a talent scout for young players.[28] On 7 June 2016, Messi won a libel case against La Razón newspaper and was awarded €65,000 in damages, which he donated to the charity Médecins Sans Frontières.[369] Messi made a donation worth €1 million ($1.1 million) to fight the spread of coronavirus.[370] This was split between Clinic Barcelona in Barcelona and his native Argentina.[371] In addition to this, Messi along with his fellow FC Barcelona teammates announced he would be taking a 70% cut in salaries during the 2020 coronavirus emergency, and contribute further to the club to provide fully to salaries of all the clubs employees.[372]

In November 2016, with the Argentine Football Association being run by a FIFA committee for emergency due to an economic crisis, it was reported that three of the national team's security staff told Messi that they had not received their salaries for six months. He stepped in and paid the salaries of the three members.[373][374] In February 2021, Messi donated to the Museu Nacional d'Art de Catalunya his Adidas shoes which he wore when he scored his 644th goal for Barcelona and broke Pelé's record for most goals scored for a single club; the shoes were later auctioned off in April by the museum for charity to help children with cancer and were sold for £125,000.[375]

In advance of the 2021 Copa América, Messi donated three signed shirts to the Chinese pharmaceutical firm Sinovac Biotech—whose directors spoke of their admiration for Messi—in order to secure 50,000 doses of Sinovac's COVID-19 vaccine, CoronaVac, in the hope of vaccinating all of South America's football players.[376] A deal brokered by Uruguay's president Luis Lacalle Pou, the plan to prioritise football players caused some controversy given widespread vaccine scarcity in the region, with the Mayor of Canelones Yamandú Orsi remarking that ""Just as the president manifested cooperation with CONMEBOL to vaccinate for the Copa América, he could just as well have the same consideration for Canelones"".[376]

In January 2025, Messi was presented with the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the highest civilian award of the United States, by President Joe Biden for his contributions in supporting healthcare and education programs for children around the world.[377] He would be unable to attend the ceremony due to scheduling conflicts, but sent a letter expressing his appreciation for the honor and his hopes of meeting President Biden at a later date.[378]

Street art and public murals depicting Messi are regularly painted around the world.[379][380] One prominent artwork that went viral is the Sistine Chapel of Football, a parody of Leonardo Da Vinci's The Creation of Adam that features both Messi and Diego Maradona, along with several other prominent Argentine footballers. The work is exhibited at the Sportivo Pereyra club from Barracas in Buenos Aires.[381]

Several public sculptures with Messi's likeness have been erected. Madame Tussauds unveiled their first wax sculpture of Messi at Wembley Stadium in 2012.[382] After the announcement of his first retirement from the international team in June 2016, a bronze statue of Messi was erected in Buenos Aires days later in an attempt to convince him to return.[383] A life-sized statue of Messi holding the World Cup trophy was unveiled outside the CONMEBOL headquarters in Luque, Paraguay in March 2023, a few months after Argentina's World Cup win. The statue would stand alongside those of Pelé and Maradona.[384]

Messi, a documentary by filmmaker Álex de la Iglesia, premiered at the 71st Venice International Film Festival in August 2014.[385] Messi's World Cup: The Rise of a Legend, a biographical docuseries focusing on Messi's career, his highs and lows with the Argentina national football team, and fairytale ending of with the 2022 FIFA World Cup, aired on Apple TV+ on 21 February 2024.[386]

On 4 June 2024, Messi announced the release of Más+, an American brand of sports and energy drinks.[387] Messi created the drink because he couldn't find a flavorful and healthy hydration option that suited his needs.[388] The drink was teased to debut in Miami, Florida, on 13 June 2024. It was released in Publix and Walmart stores and made available for delivery on Gopuff in South Florida the following day.[387] Más+ is affiliated with White Claw Hard Seltzer founder Mark Anthony.[389]

Later that year, on 19 September 2024, Messi announced that he would be launching a production company called 525 Rosario, named after his hometown. Headquartered in Miami and Los Angeles, the company was created to produce film, sporting events and branded commercials for athletes worldwide. It would be a joint venture with Smuggler Entertainment, who co-produced Messi's World Cup: The Rise of a Legend earlier in 2024.[390]

Since 2008, Messi has been in a relationship with Antonela Roccuzzo, who he eventually married on 30 June 2017 in their hometown of Rosario.[391][392] He has known Roccuzzo since he was five years old, as she is the cousin of his childhood best friend, Lucas Scaglia, who is also a football player.[393] After keeping their relationship private for a year, Messi first confirmed their romance in an interview in January 2009, before going public a month later during a carnival in Sitges after the Barcelona–Espanyol derby.[394]

Messi and Roccuzzo have three sons. To celebrate his partner's first pregnancy, Messi placed the ball under his shirt after scoring in Argentina's 4–0 win against Ecuador on 2 June 2012, before confirming the pregnancy in an interview two weeks later.[395] Thiago was born in Barcelona on 2 November 2012.[396] In April 2015, Messi confirmed that they were expecting another child.[397] In October 2017, his wife announced they were expecting their third child.[398] Messi and his family are Catholic.[399]

Messi enjoys a close relationship with his immediate family members, particularly his mother, Celia, whose face he has tattooed on his left shoulder. His professional affairs are largely run as a family business: his father, Jorge, has been his agent since he was 14, and his oldest brother, Rodrigo, handles his daily schedule and publicity. His mother and other brother, Matías, manage his charitable organization, the Leo Messi Foundation, and take care of personal and professional matters in Rosario.[400]

Since leaving for Spain aged 13, Messi has maintained close ties to his hometown of Rosario, even preserving his distinct Rosarino accent. He has kept ownership of his family's old house, although it has long stood empty; he maintains a penthouse apartment in an exclusive residential building for his mother, as well as a family compound just outside the city. Once when he was in training with the national team in Buenos Aires, he made a three-hour trip by car to Rosario immediately after practice to have dinner with his family, spent the night with them, and returned to Buenos Aires the next day in time for practice. Messi keeps in daily contact via phone and text with a small group of confidants in Rosario, most of whom were fellow members of ""The Machine of '87"" at Newell's Old Boys. He was on bad terms with the club after his transfer to Barcelona, but by 2012 their public feud had ended, with Newell's embracing their ties with Messi, even issuing a club membership card to his newborn son.[28][364][401] Messi has long planned to return to Rosario to end his playing career at Newell's.[402] Messi holds triple citizenship, as he is a citizen of Argentina, Italy, and Spain.[403]

Messi's financial affairs came under investigation in 2013 for suspected tax evasion. Offshore companies in tax havens Uruguay and Belize were used to evade €4.1 million in taxes related to sponsorship earnings between 2007 and 2009. An unrelated shell company in Panama set up in 2012 was subsequently identified as belonging to the Messis in the Panama Papers data leak. Messi, who pleaded ignorance of the alleged scheme, voluntarily paid arrears of €5.1 million in August 2013. On 6 July 2016, Messi and his father were both found guilty of tax fraud and were handed suspended 21-month prison sentences and respectively ordered to pay €1.7 million and €1.4 million in fines.[404] Facing the judge, he said, ""I just played football. I signed the contracts because I trusted my dad and the lawyers and we had decided that they would take charge of those things.""[405]

"
Jude Bellingham,"Jude Victor William Bellingham (born 29 June 2003) is an English professional footballer who plays as a midfielder for La Liga club Real Madrid and the England national team. Known for his pace, dribbling, passing,  he is widely regarded as one of the best players in the world.[7]

Bellingham joined Birmingham City as an under-8, became the club's youngest first-team player when he made his senior debut in August 2019, at the age of 16 years, 38 days, and played regularly during the 2019–20 season. He joined Borussia Dortmund in July 2020, and in his first appearance became their youngest goalscorer. Over three seasons with the club he made 132 appearances and won the 2020–21 DFB-Pokal; his performances in the 2022–23 season helped Dortmund finish as runners-up and earned him the Bundesliga Player of the Season award. Later that year he won both major awards for male footballers aged under 21: the Golden Boy, for nominees playing in Europe over the last calendar year,[8] and the Kopa Trophy, for the world's best over the previous season.[9][10] Bellingham then signed for Real Madrid for a fee of €103 million, and in his first season, was the club's top league scorer, helped them win the league title and the Champions League. In 2024, he was voted La Liga Player of the Season[11] and finished 3rd both for the Ballon d'Or and FIFA The Best. Bellingham was included in the FIFPRO World 11 twice consecutively in 2023 and 2024 and was awarded as the best playmaker by IFFHS in 2024. Bellingham also won the Best Midfielder award at Globe Soccer Awards in 2024.

Bellingham represented England at under-15, under-16, under-17 and under-21 levels. He made his first appearance for the senior team in November 2020, and represented the country at UEFA Euro 2020 and 2024 as well as the 2022 FIFA World Cup.

Jude Victor William Bellingham[12] was born on 29 June 2003[2] in Stourbridge, in the Metropolitan Borough of Dudley, West Midlands,[13] the eldest son of Denise and Mark Bellingham.[14][15] His father Mark was, until 2022, a sergeant in the West Midlands Police, and a prolific goalscorer in non-League football.[16][15][17] Bellingham's younger brother, Jobe, is also a footballer.[18] Bellingham was privately educated at Priory School in Edgbaston, Birmingham.[19][20] He grew up idolising Zinedine Zidane.[21] Bellingham graduated from Loughborough College with a BTEC level 3 certificate in sport in 2021.[22]

Bellingham joined Birmingham City as an under-8,[13] after playing for Stourbridge Juniors.[23] He played for their under-18 team at 14,[18] and made his debut for their under-23 team at the age of 15, on 15 October 2018 away to Nottingham Forest's U23s. Entering the game after an hour, he scored the only goal in the 87th minute ""sliding in to force the ball over the goal line after pressure by Kyle McFarlane on the keeper diverted the ball into his path.""[24] By March 2019, he had three goals from ten development squad appearances,[25] had featured in FourFourTwo's list of the ""50 most exciting teenagers in English football"",[26] and was mentioned as of interest to major European clubs.[25][27] He was gradually introduced to the first-team environment while still a schoolboy: increasingly training with the seniors, he accompanied them on matchday to observe,[18] and travelled as the ""19th man"" for a Championship match in March.[25]

Bellingham took up a two-year scholarship with Birmingham City to begin in July 2019.[28] He was part of the first-team training camp in Portugal,[29] played and scored in pre-season friendlies,[30] and was given squad number 22 for the 2019–20 season.[31] On 6 August, when he started the EFL Cup first round visit to Portsmouth, Bellingham became the youngest first-team player in Birmingham City's history. At 16 years, 38 days, he lowered the record set by Trevor Francis in 1970 by 101 days.[13] He played for 80 minutes in the 3–0 defeat, and was the Birmingham Mail's man of the match.[32] He made his first Football League appearance 19 days later, as a second-half substitute in a 3–0 defeat away to Swansea City,[33] and his home debut on 31 August against Stoke City. Replacing the injured Jefferson Montero after half an hour, Bellingham scored the winner – albeit via a generous deflection – as Birmingham came back from 1–0 down to beat Stoke 2–1, and thus became their youngest goalscorer, aged 16 years, 63 days.[34] He started the next match, away to Charlton Athletic two weeks later, and scored the only goal from Kerim Mrabti's cutback.[35]

Bellingham continued as a permanent fixture in the matchday squad, sometimes as a substitute but mainly in the starting eleven.[20] He was eased into the team on the left wing, moved into central midfield ""where he could gain more confidence"", and then used ""in a more advanced role"" once the staff were sure he could cope with the responsibility.[20] He was EFL Young Player of the Month for November 2019.[15] According to head coach Pep Clotet, Bellingham himself ""feels more comfortable in midfield, and more comfortable when he can get closer to the opposition box.""[36]

Bellingham was linked with moves to numerous major clubs in January 2020;[37] on deadline day, Birmingham were reported to have turned down a £20 million bid from Manchester United.[38] Bellingham continued as a first-team regular, and by the time the season was suspended because of the COVID-19 pandemic, he had made 32 league appearances. He remained an integral part of the team once the season resumed behind closed doors,[33] and set up a late equaliser for Lukas Jutkiewicz against Charlton Athletic that made Birmingham's league position less precarious with two matches still to play.[39] He finished the season with four goals from 44 appearances in all competitions, 41 in the league, as Birmingham avoided relegation despite losing the last match of the season.[33][40] In appreciation of what Bellingham achieved in such a short time with the first team, the club announced that they would retire his number 22 shirt, ""to remember one of our own and to inspire others.""[41] At the EFL Awards, he was named both Championship Apprentice of the Year and EFL Young Player of the Season.[42]

It was clear that Bellingham would leave Birmingham, and it was reported that he and his father had visited several major clubs, of which Manchester United and Bundesliga club Borussia Dortmund were the favourites.[43] Impressed by Dortmund's record of including young players as regulars in the first team, as evidenced by the likes of Jadon Sancho, Bellingham reportedly settled on the club as his destination of choice. He flew to Germany for a medical, and the transfer was confirmed on 20 July 2020. Bellingham was to join after Birmingham's last match of the season.[43] The undisclosed fee was understood by Sky Sports to be an initial £25 million – making him the most expensive 17-year-old in history – plus ""several million more"" dependent on performance-related criteria.[43]

Bellingham made his debut on 14 September 2020, starting the first match of the 2020–21 season against third-tier MSV Duisburg in the DFB-Pokal, aged 17 years, 77 days. After half an hour, he scored the second goal in a 5–0 win, becoming the club's youngest goalscorer in the DFB-Pokal, taking six days off Giovanni Reyna's record, as well as their youngest scorer in any competitive match, breaking Nuri Şahin's record by five days.[44] Five days later, he marked his league debut with the assist for Reyna's opening goal in a 3–0 win over Borussia Mönchengladbach,[45] and was named as Bundesliga Rookie of the Month for September.[46] When Bellingham faced Lazio in the group stage on 20 October, aged 17 years and 113 days, he became the youngest Englishman to start a UEFA Champions League match, breaking the record previously set by Phil Foden.[47]

In the first three months of the season, Bellingham was a regular in all competitions, with six starts and seven substitute appearances in the Bundesliga as well as four Champions League starts.[2] He missed the first two matches of 2021 with a foot injury,[48] but returned to action as an increasingly regular starter.[2] He scored his first Bundesliga goal from Reyna's knock-down to equalise with VfB Stuttgart early in the second half of a 3–2 win on 10 April.[49] His first Champions League goal came four days later against Manchester City in the quarter-final second leg, but Dortmund could not retain their away-goal advantage.[50] Bellingham started in Dortmund's 4–1 victory over RB Leipzig in the 2021 DFB-Pokal final. He was booked in the first half and replaced by Thorgan Hazard at half-time with his team 3–0 ahead.[51] He finished the season with 29 appearances and one goal in the Bundesliga, 46 appearances and four goals in all competitions,[2] and was voted Newcomer of the Season by his fellow players.[52] Bellingham was runner-up to Pedri of Barcelona in the 2021 Kopa Trophy, awarded to the world's best under-21 male player as voted by previous winners of the Ballon d'Or.[53][10]

On 4 December 2021, Bellingham played in Der Klassiker against Bayern Munich. He made the assists for both Dortmund goals,[54] but Bayern won the match 3–2 via a 77th-minute penalty awarded after lengthy VAR involvement. Earlier in the fixture, two Dortmund penalty appeals were turned down by referee Felix Zwayer, who refused to review either.[55][56] Interviewed live by Viaplay immediately after the match, Bellingham was critical of Zwayer's decisions, and made reference to his part in the 2005 German football match-fixing scandal, saying: ""You give a referee, that has match fixed before, the biggest game in Germany. What do you expect?""[57] The German Football Association (DFB) wrote to Bellingham asking for his comments as a matter of urgency,[57] and he was fined €40,000.[58]

On 22 October 2022, Bellingham scored twice in a 5–0 defeat of Stuttgart that put Borussia Dortmund into the top four; his first opened the scoring from a rapid attack that he both started and finished, his second was a skilfully curved shot early in the second half.[59] On the final day of the Bundesliga season, Dortmund needed to beat Mainz 05 to ensure the league title. Bellingham was on the bench because of an injured knee, and remained unused. Dortmund managed to draw after falling 2–0 behind, but Bayern Munich's 89th-minute winner against 1. FC Köln was enough to put them ahead on goal difference. After the match, a tearful Bellingham pushed cameras away as he left the field.[60][61] His performances earned him the Bundesliga Player of the Season award.[62] Having finished as runner-up two years prior, Bellingham won the Kopa Trophy in 2023 in recognition of his performances over the 2022–23 season for Dortmund and for England in the 2022 FIFA World Cup. He became the first Englishman to receive the award, which was presented at the 2023 Ballon d'Or ceremony in October.[9] He placed 18th in the Ballon d'Or voting.[9]

On 14 June 2023, Real Madrid announced the signing of Bellingham on a six-year contract.[63] Borussia Dortmund would receive a base transfer fee of €103 million with potential to rise by 30% to approximately €133.9 million due to add-ons,[64] from which a sell-on clause would earn Birmingham City around £6 million.[65] He became the sixth Englishman to join Real Madrid in the professional era.[66][A]

On 12 August 2023, Bellingham marked his debut with a close-range half-volleyed goal from a corner kick in a 2–0 La Liga win away to Athletic Bilbao.[67] Two goals and an assist for Vinícius Júnior in a 3–1 victory at Almería[68] and the winner at Celta Vigo in the two remaining August matches made him the league's top scorer and the first English recipient of the La Liga Player of the Month award.[69] A 95th-minute winner against Getafe on 2 September in his first match at the newly renovated Santiago Bernabéu made Bellingham the third player (after Cristiano Ronaldo in the 2009–10 season and Pepillo in 1959–60) to score in each of his first four competitive appearances for the club.[70] Bellingham scored 10 goals in his first 10 matches for Madrid, equalling Cristiano Ronaldo's goal tally after his first 10 games for the club in 2009.[71] On 28 October, Bellingham scored a brace, including a stoppage-time winner, to secure Real Madrid a 2–1 away win against their rivals Barcelona, making him the first Real Madrid player to score in their La Liga and Champions League debuts for the club and in El Clásico.[72] His first goal, scored from 30 yards (27 m)[73] was his club's 300th in El Clásico and made him the first Englishman to score in that fixture since Michael Owen in 2005.[74] Bellingham set several records with these goals.[B] His coach Carlo Ancelotti commented: ""He seems like a veteran, the goal to level it totally changed the game... Today he was stupendous and shocked everyone with his wonderful goal from the edge of the area.""[73] Bellingham was named La Liga Player of the Month for October.[79]

Having received the Kopa Trophy a few weeks earlier,[9] Bellingham was named winner of the Golden Boy for 2023, an award made to the best male under-21 footballer playing in the European top divisions over a calendar year.[8] Bellingham dislocated his left shoulder on 5 November, and returned to action against Cádiz three weeks later only because of an injury crisis at the club. Wearing heavy strapping, he assisted the first goal and scored the third of a 3–0 win, which took Madrid top of the table and his personal total to 14 from his first 15 games, breaking the club record held jointly by Pruden, Alfredo Di Stéfano and Cristiano Ronaldo.[80][81] In a 4–2 victory against Napoli on 29 November, Bellingham became the first player to score in each of his first four Champions League appearances for Real Madrid.[82]

Bellingham scored twice in a 4–0 win over La Liga title race rivals Girona on 10 February 2024.[83] He was sent off for protesting at the end of Real Madrid's 2–2 draw with Valencia at the Mestalla on 2 March after what would have been his winning goal was denied because referee Jesús Gil Manzano had blown the whistle to end the game.[84][85] He scored the winner in added time as Real Madrid won El Clásico 3–2 at home on 21 April;[86] it was his 21st goal of the season, and made him Madrid's all-time top English scorer, overtaking Laurie Cunningham and David Beckham.[87] The following day he was named as winner of the 2024 Laureus World Sports Award for Breakthrough of the Year.[88] He concluded his domestic season as Real Madrid's top league scorer with 19 goals and 6 assists as they won the La Liga title, a performance that earned him the La Liga Player of the Season award.[11] Facing his former club Borussia Dortmund in the Champions League final, Bellingham produced the assist for Vinícius Júnior to complete a 2–0 win.[89] With four goals, five assists and a passing accuracy of 90.5%, Bellingham was named the UEFA Champions League Young Player of the Season.[90]

On 14 August 2024, Bellingham started his second season in Spain, providing the assist for his new Real teammate Kylian Mbappé's debut goal, as Madrid defeated Atalanta 2–0 to win a record-breaking sixth European Super Cup.[91] On 9 November, Bellingham scored his first goal of the season and first for Madrid since May 2024 in a dominant 4–0 home win over Osasuna.[92]

Bellingham was eligible to play for his native England and also for the Republic of Ireland, for which he qualified via a grandparent.[93] He made his England under-15 debut against Turkey in December 2016.[94] In recognition of his captaining that team during the 2017–18 season, he was presented with a Special Achievement Award at the 2018 Birmingham City Academy awards night.[95] By the end of 2018 he had made his first appearance for the England under-16 team, and went on to feature in eleven games, score four goals, and captain the team.[96][97] He was included in England's under-17 squad for the Syrenka Cup, a friendly tournament held in September 2019 in preparation for the 2020 European Championship qualifiers the following March.[98] He made his debut as a substitute in England's opening match of the tournament, a 5–0 win over Finland in which he scored the third goal,[99] and captained the team in their second fixture, in which they came back from a goal behind to beat Austria 4–2 and qualify for the final. Again, Bellingham scored the third goal.[100] He retained the captaincy for the final, in which England beat hosts Poland on penalties following a 2–2 draw,[101] and was named player of the tournament.[102]

Bellingham received his first call-up to the under-21 squad for European Championship qualifiers against Kosovo and Austria in September 2020.[103] He became the youngest player to appear for England U21 when he came on to replace Tom Davies after 62 minutes of the match against Kosovo on 4 September with England 3–0 ahead, and scored after 85 minutes to complete the 6–0 victory.[104]

In November 2020, after James Ward-Prowse and Trent Alexander-Arnold withdrew through injury, Bellingham was called up to the England senior squad for the first time.[105] He made his debut in a friendly match against the Republic of Ireland at Wembley on 12 November,[106] replacing Mason Mount after 73 minutes of a 3–0 win.[107] At 17 years, 136 days, he became England's third-youngest full international; only Theo Walcott and Wayne Rooney had appeared at a younger age.[107] Bellingham was named in the England squad for the UEFA Euro 2020 tournament, which was delayed until June 2021 because of the COVID-19 pandemic.[108] When he came on as an 82nd-minute substitute in England's opening match, a 1–0 win over Croatia at Wembley on 13 June, aged 17 years and 349 days, he became both the youngest Englishman to play at any major tournament and the youngest of any nationality to play at a European Championship;[109] the latter record was broken by Poland's Kacper Kozłowski just six days later.[110]

Bellingham's first senior international goal, a header from Luke Shaw's cross to open the scoring in England's 6–2 victory over Iran in their first game of the 2022 FIFA World Cup on 21 November, made him the second youngest scorer for England at a World Cup. He also made the run and pass to Harry Kane who crossed for Raheem Sterling to score England's third goal, and played the through ball from which Callum Wilson set up their sixth for Jack Grealish.[111][112] He followed this up during the last-16 game against Senegal with a run through the defence, assisting Jordan Henderson's goal in the 38th minute, and played a key role in Harry Kane's goal in first-half stoppage time, setting up Phil Foden to make the assist.[113]

Bellingham was named in England's 26-man squad for UEFA Euro 2024.[114] His powerful header from Bukayo Saka's deflected cross gave ""The Three Lions"" a 1–0 victory against Serbia, and he was named player of the match.[115]

He scored with a 95th-minute overhead kick in the round of 16 against Slovakia to tie the scores at 1–1 and take the match into extra time.[116] England won 2–1, and Bellingham was again named player of the match.[117] After scoring the equaliser, Bellingham gestured towards the opposing substitutes' bench by grabbing his crotch, claiming it was an inside joke aimed at ""some close friends"".[118] After an investigation, UEFA found he had ""violat[ed] the basic rules of decent conduct"", fined him €30,000 and imposed a one-match ban suspended for 12 months.[119]

Bellingham played the full 120 minutes of the quarter-final against Switzerland, and scored the second kick of the penalty shootout which England won 5–3.[120] England reached the final, in which they faced Spain, who took the lead shortly after half-time. Bellingham touched Saka's pass to Cole Palmer who equalised after 73 minutes, but Spain scored a late winner and England ended the tournament as runners-up.[121]

Known for his exceptional control of the ball, his physicality and his technical quality, Bellingham is often regarded as one of the best and most well-rounded midfielders in the world.[122][123][124][125][126] He is also known for his versatility and vision.[122][127][126] He is praised for fulfilling multiple positions and his dynamic playing style, playing both exceptional defence and attack, described by The Analyst as a ""do-it-all midfielder"".[125] His excellent runs and dribbling abilities have also earned him praise, as have his keen ability to quickly transition from defence to attack.[125] An analysis by Andy Smith for the Bundesliga described Bellingham as ""the complete package: a dynamic midfielder who can win the ball and drive it forward, hold up possession, resist the press, find gaps in opposition defences, plus assist and score goals"".[127] Bellingham has been described by Philipp Lahm as a ""complete midfielder"", who can ""dribble, pass, shoot and has the urge to score"", and who is ""physical and fearless, holds his ground in challenges and wins the ball"".[124] Phil Foden described Bellingham as ""one of the most gifted players I've ever seen"".[126] Paul Scholes also praised Bellingham in 2023, saying that ""I think Jude Bellingham for his age and what he's accomplished so far in his short career, he's better than anything we've seen"".[128] He has been compared to Zinedine Zidane.[129][130][131]

Following his move to Madrid in 2023, Bellingham took on a more advanced role in the midfield, often being positioned in the number 10 position as an attacking midfielder, or even as a false 9 or second striker on occasion.[132][133][134] This change in position led to Bellingham adopting a more significant role in the final third and scoring goals: 10 in his first 10 matches for Madrid.[71][81]

His prodigious talent as a young player has been confirmed by the awards he has won, including the IFFHS World's Best Youth (U20) Player in 2022 and 2023,[135][136] and the Golden Boy award and Kopa Trophy in 2023.[8][9] ESPN rated Bellingham as the number one central midfielder for 2022–23,[137] and 90min rated him as the top central midfielder in 2022.[138]

In May 2024, Bellingham signed a multi-year deal with sports drink Lucozade becoming the face of the brand's multi-million pound TV campaign.[139] In June 2024, he appeared in Kim Kardashian's shapewear and clothing brand Skims' campaign; the photoshoot featured Bellingham modelling men's underwear.[140] In July 2024, Bellingham was revealed as the cover star for the video game EA Sports FC 25.[141] In the same month, Adidas launched Bellingham's first-ever signature collection, featuring a jersey, tracksuit, ringer tee, and shorts, all adorned with the JB monogram logo.[142] In August 2024, Louis Vuitton named Bellingham as a ""Friend of the House,"" announcing their partnership.[143] In September 2024. Bellingham started his official channel on YouTube with a behind-the-scenes documentary of his first year in Spain.[144] In December 2024, Bellingham appeared in Adidas’ documentary film Under the Tongue.[145]

Raphinha,"Raphael Dias Belloli (born 14 December 1996), known as Raphinha, is a Brazilian professional footballer who plays as a forward for La Liga club Barcelona and the Brazil national team. Considered one of the best players in the world, he is known for his technical ability, pace, and dribbling.[4][5]

Raphinha began his career with Brazilian club Avaí, before signing for the Portuguese Vitória de Guimarães in 2016, where he made his professional debut. In 2018, he joined fellow Primeira Liga club Sporting CP, winning the double of the Taça de Portugal and Taça da Liga in 2019. After having spells for Rennes and Leeds United, he signed for Spanish club Barcelona in 2022 for a transfer worth €58 million (£50 million).

After never being capped at youth level, he made his senior international debut in 2021 and was part of Brazil's squads at the 2022 FIFA World Cup and the 2024 Copa América.

Raphinha was born in Porto Alegre, Brazil where he grew up in Restinga, a favela far from the city centre.[6][7][8] His father is of Italian descent and his mother is mixed-race Brazilian.[9] His father was a jobbing musician.[10] He had a difficult upbringing where he describes sharing a bedroom with his parents, younger brother and pets; struggling to pay travel costs and at points having to beg for food.[6]

At the age of seven, he attended Ronaldinho's birthday party due to his father and uncle's relationship with the player.[6] They have met numerous times since and have developed a lasting friendship.[6]

Before starting his professional football career, Raphinha participated in the várzea tournaments until the age of 18,[11] which he describes as ""a network of independent matches and tournaments organised by the local community"" below academy level in which any prospective player is allowed to participate.[6] The matches in these tournaments are played under harsh conditions, including home fans harassing opponent team players near changing rooms before matches, gunshots, clay pitches with dust and sand, intense heat, posts instead of nets and shirtless teams due to the lack of bibs.[6]

He has a long-standing friendship with Bruno Fernandes, starting before they became teammates at Sporting CP.[6] According to Raphinha, Fernandes has been a huge help to him and his footballing career.[6] Before joining Leeds United, Fernandes told Raphinha that his style would ""fit the league"" (in reference to the Premier League).[6]

After unsuccessful trials with Internacional and Grêmio, Raphinha started his career playing youth football with Imbituba, where he was later scouted by Avaí.[10] At 18 years old, Raphinha started his career with the Avaí's under-20 team in the Campeonato Brasileiro Série A in 2014.[8][6] After being injured, he was unable to make the squad but continued to train on his own.[6] Despite growing interest in Raphinha from many of Brazil's top clubs, Avaí retained him until 2016, where he showcased his skills at Copa São Paulo de Futebol Júnior.[10]

On 2 February 2016, Raphinha signed for Portuguese side Vitória de Guimarães, having been scouted at the Copa São Paulo de Futebol Júnior by Deco, who signed him to his agency, D20 Sports, and arranged his transfer to Vitória.[10][12] He made his debut for the Vimaranenses on 13 March 2016 against Paços de Ferreira.[13] He scored his first goal for the club against Marítimo on 20 August 2016.[14] He made his first appearance in the 2017–18 UEFA Europa League on 14 September 2017 against Red Bull Salzburg.[14] He won the Vitória Guimarães Breakthrough Player of the Year in 2017.[15] He scored 18 goals during 43 games (in all competitions) during the 2017–18 Primeira Liga season for Vitória de Guimarães.[8]

In May 2018, he transferred to Portuguese club Sporting CP until 2019.[16] He made his debut on 12 August against Moreirense. He scored his first goal for the club on 20 September 2018 against Qarabag in the 2–0 victory in the 2018–19 UEFA Europa League.[17] He struggled in finishing with only four goals and as many assists, in particular due to a muscle injury which hampered his progress, but was a part of the side that won the 2018–19 Taça da Liga and Taça de Portugal, scoring a penalty in the penalty shootout victory against Porto.[18][14]

He signed for French club Rennes in 2019, with a transfer fee around €21 million,[19] the club's record signing.[14] He scored and gained an assist in his final game for the club during the 2020–21 Ligue 1 fixture against Reims in a 2–2 draw on 4 October 2020.[20] He scored eight goals and gained seven assists during his time at the club, where he helped Rennes to a third-place finish and qualify for the 2020–21 UEFA Champions League during the 2019–20 Ligue 1 season.[21]

On 5 October 2020, he joined Leeds United on a four-year contract for an undisclosed fee reported to be in the region of £17 million, or about €20 million.[22][23]

On 19 October 2020, he made his debut as a second-half substitute in a 1–0 loss to Wolverhampton Wanderers.[24] His full debut was at home to Arsenal on 22 November 2020.[25] On 28 November 2020, Raphinha scored his first Leeds goal in a 1–0 away win over Everton.[26] His winning goal secured Leeds' first ever Premier League win at Goodison Park and their first league win at Everton since 1990.[27] He finished the season with six goals, all from league fixtures.[citation needed]

Raphinha scored his first goal of the season on 21 August 2021, in Leeds' first home game, a low-struck 72nd-minute equaliser from just inside the penalty area, in a 2–2 result against Everton,[28] which was nominated as one of the Premier League's Goals of the Month for August.[29][30]

Raphinha ended the season as Leeds' top goalscorer with 11 goals, including the first goal of the game in the 2–1 away win against Brentford on the last day of the season, from the penalty spot after being fouled by the Brentford goalkeeper David Raya, confirming Leeds' Premier League status.[31]

Over the summer transfer window, Chelsea had an agreement in place with Leeds to sign him, with both clubs agreeing a fee worth of £55 million, despite Arsenal and Tottenham Hotspur's interest. However, Raphinha's preferred a move to Barcelona, despite their financial struggles. This led to Raphinha flying to Barcelona to complete a deal, being left out of Leeds's squad for their pre-season tour to Australia in order to finalise a transfer.[32][33]

On 15 July 2022, Raphinha signed for La Liga club Barcelona on a five-year contract for a reported initial fee of £50m, potentially rising to £55 million in add-ons.[34][35] He was initially presented without a name or number on his shirt due to registration issues, with the club needing to sell players to register players and make new signings.[36]

On 13 August, he made his debut for the club in 0–0 draw against Rayo Vallecano in the league.[37] On 3 September, he scored his first Barcelona goal in a 3–0 victory over Sevilla at the Ramón Sánchez Pizjuán Stadium.[38] On 13 September, he made his continental debut for the club starting in the 2–0 loss to Bayern Munich in the Champions League.[39] At the end of the group stage, Barcelona finished third, which put them in the Europa League knockout round play-offs for the second consecutive season.[40] Signed to be a replacement for struggling Ousmane Dembélé, both competed for a starting spot with manager Xavi insisting that he wanted to keep both players, hoping to breed competition between them for starting spots on a team that was short on wingers.[41] Over the course of the season, Dembélé's resurgence in form, limited his opportunities to impress at his preferred right-wing position.[41]

On 16 January 2023, Barcelona won the 2023 Supercopa de España final, following a 3–1 victory over rivals Real Madrid in El Clásico, winning his first title with the club.[42] On 16 February, Raphinha assisted and scored in a 2–2 draw against Manchester United in a knockout round play-off in the Europa League at the Camp Nou.[43] Barcelona was eliminated from the tournament after losing 2–1 at the away leg at Old Trafford.[44] At the second part of the season, he was handed a chance to impress when Dembélé picked up a muscle injury, but was inconsistent over that period, leading Raphinha to be in and out of the starting XI.[41] On 14 May, he assisted Robert Lewandowski's second goal, as Barcelona defeated Espanyol 4–2 in the Derbi Barceloní, confirming them as La Liga champions.[45][46]

After missing part of the new season, Raphinha struggled to meet the expectations of fans and Barcelona's management in La Liga, despite support from his manager Xavi. He eventually lost his spot in the starting XI to young prospect Lamine Yamal, who had already scored during Raphinha's absence due to injury and at the end of the first part of the season, he had scored only three goals.[47][48][49][50]

Despite a disappointing overall season, Raphinha played a key role in Barcelona's Champions League campaign, being involved in two goals in their 3–1 win over Napoli on 12 March, in the home leg, knocking them out with a 4–2 aggregate score.[51] On 10 April 2024, he scored his first Champions League goal by netting a brace in a 3–2 away win against Ligue 1 champions Paris Saint-Germain at the Parc des Princes in the quarter-final first leg,[52] and awarded as the Player of the Match.[53] In the return leg at home, despite scoring the opening goal, the Parisian team overturned the aggregate score with a 4–1 win, eliminating Barça.[54]

Despite recording 10 goals and 11 assists in 37 appearances in the his previous season, his future at the Spanish club was uncertain and with Xavi leaving the managerial role, he was linked with a move away from the club, in order for Barcelona to raise funds amid their financial difficulties.[55][56] He was the recipient of a contract offer worth €90 million from Saudi Pro League side Al-Hilal, with Barcelona's sporting director Deco informing his agent to look for another team for him.[57][58][59] However, Hansi Flick, who replaced Xavi as the new manager, decided to keep him.[60][61][62] Highlighting his importance to the team, Flick named him as one of the team's captains for the season.[63]

Flick began his tenure with a different tactical approach than his predecessor, he positioned Raphinha centrally, behind Robert Lewandowski and flanked by wingers, which saw his form improve dramatically. On 31 August 2024, he scored his first hat-trick for Barcelona in a 7–0 win at home against Real Valladolid in a La Liga match.[64] Later that year, on 23 October, he scored a hat-trick in the Champions League in a 4–1 home win against Bayern Munich in the group stage and was named Player of the Match.[65] A few days later, on 26 October, he netted his first goal in El Clásico and provided an assist in a 4–0 away win over Real Madrid.[66] During the match at the Santiago Bernabéu, Raphinha and his Barcelona teammates Lamine Yamal and Ansu Fati were targeted with racial abuse by a group of home supporters.[67] On 12 January 2025, he was named Player of the Match,[68] after scoring a brace and providing an assist in a 5–2 victory over Real Madrid in the Supercopa de España final.[69] On 21 January 2025, he was named player of the match once again, after leading Barcelona to a comeback victory against Benfica in the Champions League. He contributed a brace, including a decisive goal in injury time, to secure a 5–4 away win.[70]

In August 2021, Raphinha was selected to represent Brazil for the team's World Cup qualifiers against Chile, Argentina and Peru.[71]

On 7 October 2021, Raphinha made his full debut for the national side, coming on as a substitute at half time in a 3–1 comeback win against Venezuela.[72] He assisted two goals and won a penalty in 45 minutes on the pitch, receiving praise from sports pundits and fans.[73] On 15 October, he scored his first two international goals in a qualifying match against Uruguay.[74]

On 7 November 2022, Raphinha was named in the squad for the 2022 FIFA World Cup by manager Tite.[75] Brazil reached the quarter-finals of the tournament, where they were eliminated by Croatia on 9 December, following a 4–2 penalty shoot-out loss after a 1–1 draw.[76]

On 10 May, he was called up for Brazil to participate in the 2024 Copa América.[77] He scored his only goal of the tournament against Colombia in their third group phase game, in a 1–1 draw.[78] Brazil were eliminated from the tournament following a 4–2 penalty shoot-out defeat after a goalless draw against Uruguay in the quarter-finals.[79][80]

Raphinha is a versatile winger known for his technical ability, agility, pace and defensive work rate. Primarily operating on the right-wing, he uses his left foot to cut inside, creating goal-scoring opportunities or delivering passes into dangerous areas. His dribbling, characterized by close control, rapid changes of direction, and a blend of speed and creativity, allows him to beat defenders in one-on-one situations. A proficient passer, Raphinha delivers accurate crosses and threads passes into the box, stretching opposition defenses while also operating effectively in tight spaces. Defensively, he plays an important role in counter-pressing, regaining possession by tracking back to support full-backs or disrupting opposition build-up play.[81][82][83][84][85]

At Barcelona under Hansi Flick, Raphinha's tactical role evolved from a traditional winger to a more centrally positioned in a second striker role. This shift allowed him to exploit spaces between the opposition's defensive and midfield lines, making diagonal runs into the box or drifting inward while other forwards, such as Robert Lewandowski, provided width. By not being confined to the flank, Raphinha stretched the defensive structure, creating additional space and opportunities for himself and his teammates. His quick change of pace and intelligent movement enabled link-up play with players like Dani Olmo, while also supporting attacking moves from deeper positions.[86]

Vin%C3%ADcius J%C3%BAnior,"Vinícius José Paixão de Oliveira Júnior (Brazilian Portuguese: [viˈnisjuz ʒoˈzɛ pajˈʃɐ̃w̃ dʒi oliˈvejɾɐ ˈʒũɲoʁ]; born 12 July 2000), commonly known as Vinícius Júnior or Vini Jr., is a Brazilian professional footballer who plays as a forward for La Liga club Real Madrid and the Brazil national team. Considered one of the best players in the world, he is known for his pace, technique and dribbling ability.[3]

Born in São Gonçalo, Vinícius began his professional career at Flamengo, where he made his senior debut in 2017, at age 16. A few weeks later, Vinícius was the subject of a transfer to La Liga club Real Madrid, for whom he signed in a £38 million deal, which was a national record for an U-18 player.[4] The transfer was made effective after his 18th birthday, with Vinícius debuting for the club in 2018–19. Over the following seasons, Vinícius established himself as a prominent member in Real Madrid's squad, helping the club win two La Liga–Champions League doubles, scoring the winning goal in the 2022 and 2024 finals, being named the tournament's Player of the Season in 2024.[5][6][7] Vinícius was included in the FIFPRO World XI in 2023 and 2024, and was named The Best FIFA Men's Player in 2024.[8] He also came runner up in the 2024 Ballon d'Or.

At his youth stage for Brazil, Vinícius was a key player in the victory at the 2015 South American U-15 Championship and 2017 South American U-17 Championship, finishing as leading goalscorer in the latter competition. He made his senior debut in 2021 and helped his nation to a runner-up finish at the 2021 Copa América, also representing Brazil at the 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar and the 2024 Copa América in the United States.

His footballing career began in 2006, when his father took him to the branch offices of Flamengo, in the neighborhood of Mutuá, in São Gonçalo where he lived. His club document described him as a left-back.

Hailing from a poor Catholic family,[9] Vinícius went to live in Abolição with his uncle, Ulisses, to shorten the distance to Ninho do Urubu (the ""Vultures' Nest""). He started to receive financial aid from Flamengo as well as aid from entrepreneurs.[10]

Between 2007 and 2010, Vinícius attended futsal classes at Flamengo's school in São Gonçalo at the Canto do Rio, a famous club located in the centre of Niterói. Flamengo noted his potential and he decided he wanted to play football, not futsal. In August 2010, Vinícius had a trial to play for the Flamengo youth team, and he accepted an invitation to play for their football team.[11] Before, in 2009, when Vinícius was nine, he took a futsal trial for Flamengo, he was asked to come back the following year.[citation needed]

Vinícius debuted for Flamengo on 13 May 2017 as an 82nd-minute substitute in a Brazilian Série A 1–1 draw against Atlético Mineiro.[12][13] Two days later he extended his contract with the club from 2019 until 2022, with a significant salary increase and a buyout clause increase from €30 million to €45 million.[14] This contract renewal was reported as being part of the transfer process of Vinícius to Real Madrid, an agreement reached between the two clubs in Gávea that week with an obligation to sell the young player in July 2018.[15]

On 10 August 2017, Vinícius scored the first professional goal of his career in a Copa Sudamericana second round leg 2 match against Palestino in a 5–0 win for Flamengo.

On 19 August, he scored his first Brazilian Série A goals for Flamengo, in a 2–0 win against Atlético Goianiense.[16][17][18][19][20][excessive citations]

On 23 May 2017, La Liga club Real Madrid signed a contract to acquire Vinícius, effective after his 18th birthday on 12 July 2018 (as age 18 is the minimum age for international transfer).[21] He transferred for a reported fee of €46 million, which was at the time, the second most expensive sale of a player in the history of Brazilian football (behind only Neymar), the largest amount received by a Brazilian club for a transfer, and the highest amount ever paid by a club for a footballer under the age of 19.[22][23] He was originally scheduled to return to Brazil on loan in July 2018.[21]

On 20 July 2018, he was officially presented as a Real Madrid player.[24] He was issued squad number 28.[25] He made his debut on 29 September, coming in as an 87th-minute substitute in a goalless draw against Atlético Madrid.[26] Vinícius made his first start on 31 October in a 4–0 Copa del Rey away victory against Melilla,[27] contributing with assists for both Marco Asensio and Álvaro Odriozola in what Marca recognised as a Man of the Match performance.[25] He scored his first goal on 3 November 10 minutes after coming on as a substitute in a 2–0 victory against Real Valladolid.[28] He scored four goals between his debut on 29 September and 7 February 2019.[29] On 6 March, he tore a ligament during a loss to Ajax, which ended his season.[30]

In the aftermath of Hazard's departure, Real Madrid confirmed that Vinícius, who previously wore the No. 20 shirt, would be sporting the club's iconic No. 7 jersey, once worn by Cristiano Ronaldo and Raúl, from 2023–24 season onwards.[53][54]

On 19 August 2023, Vinícius scored the decisive goal in a La Liga match against Almería, contributing to Real Madrid's victory alongside teammate Jude Bellingham, who netted the previous two goals.[55] On 25 August 2023, Vinícius sustained an injury to his right biceps femoris muscle during a league match against Celta, a game that Real Madrid ultimately won 1–0.[56][57] On 27 September 2023, Vinícius made his return to play in a league fixture against Las Palmas after recovering from his injury.[58] On 3 October, he got his first Champions League goal of the season, netting the 1–1 equaliser in Madrid's away game against Napoli, which eventually ended in a 3–2 win.[59]

On 30 October 2015, Vinícius was called up for Brazil by coach Guilherme Dalla Déa for the South American U-15 Championship. Vinícius and Brazil won the U-15 title and he was the 2nd top-scorer of the tournament with seven goals. He was named player of the tournament and continued to perform which helped him convince Flamengo to sign him by the age of 16.[74] On 24 June 2016, Vinícius was called up for a friendly against Chile U-17 and scored two goals and provided two assists in the 4–2 victory.

In March 2017, Vinícius debuted in the South American U-17 Championship for Brazil with a goal in a 3–0 victory over Peru.[75] In the final stage, he scored two goals in a 3–0 win over Ecuador and two goals in a 3–0 victory over Colombia, securing Brazil's place in the 2017 FIFA U-17 World Cup in India, where Brazil (without Vinícius) eventually would finish third.[76][77][78] After leading Brazil to win the South American U-17 Championship, he was named the tournament's best player and was top goal-scorer with seven goals.[79]

On 28 February 2019, Vinícius was called up to the Brazil national team for the first time for friendlies against Panama and the Czech Republic.[80] However, he suffered an injury while playing for Real Madrid, and David Neres was called up in his place in March.[81] In May, he was excluded from Brazil's final 23-man squad for the 2019 Copa América by manager Tite.[82] The same year on 10 September, he debuted as a 72nd-minute substitute in Brazil's 1–0 defeat against Peru.[83]

Vinícius was named in Brazil's 2021 Copa América squad by Tite on 9 June 2021, which was held on home soil.[84] He made a substitute appearance in his country's 1–0 defeat against rivals Argentina in the final on 10 July.[85]

On 24 March 2022, Vinícius scored his debut goal for the national team, in a 4–0 home victory against Chile in a 2022 FIFA World Cup qualification match at the Maracanã Stadium.[86] On 7 November 2022, Vinícius was named in the Brazil squad for the 2022 FIFA World Cup by Tite.[87] In the opening group match against Serbia on 24 November, he set-up Richarlison's second goal to help Brazil to a 2–0 victory.[88] He scored his first FIFA World Cup goal in a 4–1 victory against South Korea in the round of 16 on 5 December, also setting up Lucas Paquetá's goal, helping Brazil qualify for the quarter-finals,[89] where they were eliminated by Croatia four days later following a 4–2 penalty shoot-out loss after a 1–1 draw.[90]

On 26 March 2024, Vinícius served as captain of the national team for the first time in a friendly match against Spain at the Santiago Bernabéu, his club's home ground.[91] At the 2024 Copa América, Vinícius scored his first two goals in the tournament in Brazil's second group match, a 4–1 win against Paraguay,[92] also picking up a yellow card; he picked up another booking in his nation's final group match, a 1–1 draw against Colombia, which ruled him out of the quarter-finals. In his absence, Brazil were eliminated following a 4–2 penalty shoot-out defeat after a goalless draw against Uruguay.[93][94]

Shortly after his arrival at Real Madrid in July 2018, ESPN journalist Dermot Corrigan described Vinícius as a ""zippy left winger or second striker"".[95] A versatile player, although he is usually deployed on the left flank, he is capable of playing anywhere along the front line, and has also been used on the right or in the centre.[96] Possessing explosive acceleration, and excellent pace, agility, balance, technique, flair, dribbling skills, and close control at speed, as well as significant power, physical strength, and trickery on the ball, despite his slender build,[97][98][99][100][101][102][excessive citations] he is known for his movement, energy, ability to run at defences, change direction quickly, and beat opponents in one on one situations while in possession of the ball.[100][103][104][105][excessive citations]

Regarded as a promising young player,[97][98][106] he is considered to be a dynamic, intelligent, hard-working, and nimble winger, with a low centre of gravity, as well as impressive passing and awareness. Moreover, he is known in for his eye for the final ball, and ability to provide assists to teammates, which make him an effective playmaker. Although he is also capable of scoring goals himself,[97][99][102] his shooting and goalscoring were initially cited by pundits as areas in need of improvement,[99][104] as his lack of end product was often a source of criticism in the media in his first few seasons at Real Madrid.[41][107] In June 2017, Vinícius appeared at 39th place on The Telegraph's list of the best under-21 players in the world. He was the only player playing in South America at the time to appear on the list.[108] In November 2018, former Argentina international frontman José Luis Calderón credited Vinícius' ""general enthusiasm, his ability to make things happen, the joy and good vibrations he transmits, his speed, the fact he's different and the fact he's daring. To sum up, he has a spark that could be used by a team that has been plain in recent matches"".[109] In his youth with Flamengo, he was criticised, however, by several football figures, fans, and the press for ""doing too many tricks"", and for ""[t]oo much individualism, not enough teamwork"".[110]

During the 2021–22 season, Vinícius had a breakthrough season with Real Madrid, and his goal scoring and assist output increased dramatically, enabling him to form an effective offensive partnership from the left wing with striker Karim Benzema.[111] Regarding his change in form, Vinícus commented in December 2021: ""I think I've improved in many things, but above all in my calmness in my play, I'm doing things with more tranquillity and more quality too.""[112] The club's manager Carlo Ancelotti also praised him for his defensive work-rate and positioning, in addition to his creative abilities[113] and talent, noting that he was able to improve upon his tactical knowledge and physical condition throughout the course of the season,[41] as well as his finishing.[110] His performances led the Spanish press to compare him to compatriot Neymar.[114] Following his goal in Real Madrid's victory in the 2022 Champions League final, Neymar himself described Vinícius as ""the best player in the world.""[115] Later that month, Ed McCambridge of FourFourTwo ranked Vinícius as the second–best left winger in the world.[116] Vinícius was also used in a free role as a left-sided forward or striker in a 4–3–1–2 formation during the 2023–24 season by manager Carlo Ancelotti; in this position, although he operated in more central areas, he was still given the freedom to move out wide or switch positions and link-up with Rodrygo on the other side of the pitch.[117]

During his spell at Real Madrid, Vinícius has been criticized for his perceived lack of discipline and sportsmanship on the field.[118][119][120] His behavior has resulted in him often receiving bookings for verbal dissent to referees and physical confrontations with opposing players.[121][122] Following an incident in March 2024 in which he pushed RB Leipzig player Willi Orbán in the neck,[123] Vinícius was criticized by former Real Madrid player Predrag Mijatović, who said that if Vinícius does not ""calm down"", he ""will never become a legendary player, regardless of the good he does in terms of football.""[124] Vinícius has also been criticized for his provocative behavior and celebrations,[125] with former Brazil coach Vanderlei Luxemburgo claiming that Vinícius provokes a lot of the treatment he receives on the field.[119][126][127] Real Madrid head coach Carlo Ancelotti admitted in March 2024 that Vinícius should ""control himself a little better"",[128] with reports from SPORT claiming that Real Madrid believed Vinícius to be hurting the club's image.[118][129]

In a few isolated incidents in 2023, Vinícius was subjected to racist slurs and chants from football fans in Spain, including an effigy of him being hanged from a bridge in Madrid.[130][131] On 23 May 2023, four men were arrested by the Spanish Police in connection with the effigy.[132] In response, Vinícius condemned La Liga for what he perceived as normalization of racism, and advocated for more stringent measures and penalties to combat racist behaviour.[133] On 22 May 2023, Real Madrid released an official statement strongly condemning the racist abuse against Vinícius, viewing it as a direct attack on the democratic coexistence model of Spain; the club reported the incident as a ""hate crime"" to the Attorney General's Office, reserving its right to act as a private prosecutor in any ensuing proceedings.[134] On 15 June 2023, Vinícius was selected by FIFA president Gianni Infantino to lead a special FIFA anti-racism committee composed of players.[135][136]

Certain experts believe the global outrage and outpouring of support for Vinícius following his stand against racism could mark a turning point in the fight against racism in football and Spain in general.[137] Guy Hedgecoe of BBC News said the issue has transcended the borders of Spain and of sport, as public figures from around the world are acknowledging that for which he stands.[138] Brazilian president Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva condemned racism and expressed his solidarity towards Vinícius while urging FIFA and other responsible football bodies to take the strongest actions possible.[139] Brazil's iconic Christ the Redeemer statue switched off its lights in a show of support for Vinícius following racial slurs from Valencia fans at the Mestalla Stadium in Spain.[140] Sean Gregory, writing for Time asserted: ""The effects of racist abuse in the world’s most popular game are felt far beyond the stadium walls, that the ugliness persists in 2023 also on full, terrible display, at stadiums around the world is a forever stain on the so-called beautiful game.""[141] In Rio de Janeiro, representatives of more than 150 activist groups and non-profits delivered a letter to Spain's consulate, demanding an investigation into the league and its president.[142] Flavio Dino, Brazil's minister of justice threatened Spain with applying principle of extraterritoriality over the Vinícius racism case, a penal code that protects Brazilian's human rights.[143] Various sporting figures from around the world, including Formula One world champion Lewis Hamilton, coach Xavi, coach Carlo Ancelotti, pundit Rio Ferdinand, Real Madrid Femenino, and Real Madrid Baloncesto, as well as footballers Didier Drogba, Kylian Mbappé, Iñaki Williams, Raphinha, Ronaldo, Neymar, and Rafael Leão showered him array of praises and support.[144][145] An anti-racism law (Vini Jr law) was approved and named after him, which will see sporting events stopped or suspended in the event of a racist conduct in the state of Rio de Janeiro in Brazil.[146][147] He also received awards from Rio's legislative assembly and city council and his footprints were added to the stadium's walk of fame, beside those of Brazilian greats such as Pelé, Garrincha and Ronaldo.[148] Vinícius received the Sócrates Award at the 2023 Ballon d'Or ceremony for his humanitarian projects and fight against racism.[149][150]

In 2021, he founded the Instituto Vini Jr., an organisation to facilitate access to school for Brazilian children and teenagers from disadvantaged neighborhoods.[151] In 2023, he was awarded the Sócrates Award.[152] In 2024, UNESCO appointed Vinícius Goodwill Ambassador for Education for All. He is the second footballer after Pelé to become a UNESCO ambassador.[153]

Vinícius is a Roman Catholic.[154] He runs a charitable institute in Rio – Instituto Vini Jr – which aims to use technology and sport to educate young Brazilians and, ultimately, alleviate some of the education related inequality in the country.[155][156][157] In November 2024, he conducted a DNA test which found out he had roots with the Tikar people from Cameroon and he has been duly presented with the certificate by Confederation of Brazil Football CBF.[158]

Cristiano Ronaldo,"Cristiano Ronaldo dos Santos Aveiro GOIH ComM (Portuguese pronunciation: [kɾiʃˈtjɐnu ʁɔˈnaldu] ⓘ; born 5 February 1985) is a Portuguese professional footballer who plays as a forward for and captains both Saudi Pro League club Al Nassr and the Portugal national team. Nicknamed CR7, he is widely regarded as one of the greatest players of all time, and has won numerous individual accolades throughout his professional footballing career, including five Ballon d'Or awards, three the Best FIFA Men's Player awards (formerly the FIFA World Player of the Year), a record three UEFA Men's Player of the Year Awards, and four European Golden Shoes.[note 3] He has won 33 trophies in his career, including seven league titles, five UEFA Champions Leagues and the UEFA European Championship. Ronaldo holds the records for most goals (140) and assists (42) in the Champions League, goals (14) and assists (8) in the European Championship, and most international appearances (217) and international goals (135). He is one of the few players to have made over 1,200 professional career appearances, the most by an outfield player, and has scored over 900 official senior career goals for club and country, making him the top goalscorer of all time.[note 4]

Ronaldo began his senior career with Sporting CP, before signing with Manchester United in 2003, winning the FA Cup in his first season. He went on to become a star player at United, as they won three consecutive Premier League titles, the Champions League and the FIFA Club World Cup; his 2007-08 season earned him his first Ballon d'Or, aged 23. Ronaldo was the subject of the then-most expensive association football transfer when he signed for Real Madrid in 2009 in a transfer worth €94 million (£80 million). He was integral to Madrid becoming a dominant force again, as they won four Champions Leagues from 2014 to 2018, including La Décima. He won back-to-back Ballon d'Or awards in 2013 and 2014, and again in 2016 and 2017, and was runner-up three times behind Lionel Messi, his perceived career rival. He also became the club's all-time top goalscorer and finished as the Champions League's top scorer for six consecutive seasons between 2012 and 2018. With Madrid, Ronaldo's additional titles include two La Liga titles, including a record-breaking title win in 2011-12, and two Copas del Rey. In 2018, following issues with the Madrid hierarchy, Ronaldo made a surprise transfer to Juventus in a transfer worth an initial €100 million (£88 million). He won several trophies in Italy, including two Serie A titles and a Coppa Italia, and broke several records for Juventus. He returned to United in 2021; despite a collectively disappointing season, Ronaldo's individual performances earned him being included in the PFA Team of the Year at 37 years old. His contract was terminated in 2022 due to a fall out with the newly appointed manager, and in 2023 he signed for Al Nassr, a move that since been widely credited for revolutionising football in Saudi Arabia.

Ronaldo made his international debut for Portugal in 2003 at the age of 18 and has earned more than 200 caps, making him history's most-capped male player.[8] Ronaldo has played in eleven major tournaments and scored in ten; he scored his first international goal at Euro 2004, where he helped Portugal reach the final and subsequently made the team of the tournament. In the 2006 FIFA World Cup, his first World Cup, he was a focal part to Portugal ultimately finishing in fourth place. He assumed captaincy of the national team in July 2008 ahead of Euro 2008; four years later, at Euro 2012, he was named to the team of the tournament. In 2015, Ronaldo was named the best Portuguese player of all time by the Portuguese Football Federation. The following year, he led Portugal to their first major tournament title at Euro 2016, being named in the team of the tournament for the third time and receiving the Silver Boot as the second-highest goalscorer of the tournament. This achievement saw him receive his fourth Ballon d'Or. In 2018, Ronaldo had his most prolific World Cup campaign and was voted in the Fan Dream Team. He led his country to victory in the inaugural UEFA Nations League in 2019, receiving the top scorer award in the finals, and also received the Golden Boot as top scorer of Euro 2020. In the 2022 World Cup, he became the first player to score at five World Cups.

One of the world's most marketable and famous athletes, Ronaldo was ranked the world's highest-paid athlete by Forbes in 2016, 2017, 2023, and 2024 and the world's most famous athlete by ESPN from 2016 to 2019. He is the first footballer and the third sportsman to earn US$1 billion in his career. Time included him on their list of the 100 most influential people in the world in 2014. Ronaldo is the most popular sportsperson on social media: he counts over 1 billion total followers across Facebook, Twitter, YouTube and Instagram, making him the first person to achieve that feat. Ronaldo was named in the UEFA Ultimate Team of the Year in 2015, the All-time UEFA Euro XI in 2016, and the Ballon d'Or Dream Team in 2020. In recognition of his record-breaking goalscoring success, he received special awards for Outstanding Career Achievement by FIFA in 2021 and Champions League All-Time Top Scorer by UEFA in 2024.

Cristiano Ronaldo dos Santos Aveiro was born on 5 February 1985 in the São Pedro parish of Funchal, the capital of the Portuguese island of Madeira, and grew up in the nearby parish of Santo António.[9][10] He is the fourth and youngest child of Maria Dolores dos Santos Viveiros Aveiro, who worked as a cook in the hospitality industry and a cleaning woman,[11][12] and José Dinis Aveiro, a municipal gardener at the Junta de Freguesia of Santo António and part-time kit man for football club Andorinha.[13][14][15] His great-grandmother on his father's side, Isabel da Piedade, an African woman, was born in the island of São Vicente, in what was then Portuguese Cape Verde, and moved to Madeira Island at 16.[16][17] He has one older brother, Hugo, and two older sisters, Elma and Liliana Cátia ""Kátia"".[2] He was named after actor and U.S. President Ronald Reagan, whom his father was a fan of.[18] His mother revealed that she wanted to abort him due to poverty, his father's alcoholism, and having too many children already, but her doctor refused to perform the procedure.[19][20] Ronaldo grew up in an impoverished Catholic home, sharing a room with all his siblings.[21]

As a child, Ronaldo played for Andorinha from 1992 to 1995,[22] where his father was the kit man,[13] and later spent two years with Nacional. In 1997, aged 12, he went on a three-day trial with Sporting CP, who signed him for a fee of £1,500.[23] He subsequently moved from Madeira to Lisbon to join Sporting CP's youth system.[23] By age 14, while struggling with his school duties and responsibilities in Escola EB2 de Telheiras, his school in the Telheiras area of Lisbon, Ronaldo believed he had the ability to play semi-professionally and agreed with his mother and his tutor at Sporting CP, Leonel Pontes,[24] to cease his education to focus entirely on football.[25][26] With a troubled life as a student,[27] and although living in Lisbon area away from his Madeiran family,[28][29] he did not complete schooling beyond the 6th grade.[30][31] While popular with other students at school, he had been expelled after throwing a chair at his teacher, who he said had ""disrespected"" him.[25] One year later, he was diagnosed with tachycardia, a condition that could have forced him to give up playing football.[32] Ronaldo underwent heart surgery where a laser was used to cauterise multiple cardiac pathways into one, altering his resting heart rate.[33] He was discharged from the hospital hours after the procedure and resumed training a few days later.[34] In 2021, Cristiano Ronaldo's mother, Dolores Aveiro, stated in an interview for Sporting CP's official television channel (Sporting TV) that her son would be a bricklayer if he had not become a professional football player.[35]

Growing up, Ronaldo idolised the Brazilian footballers Ronaldinho and Ronaldo Nazário, and has described them as leaving ""a beautiful history in football"".[36]

After impressing in Sporting's youth teams, he was promoted to the main team by first-team manager László Bölöni. At age 17, on 14 August 2002, he played his first official match for the first team, in a UEFA Champions League qualifying round at José Alvalade Stadium against Inter Milan,[37] and his Primeira Liga debut, took place a month later against Braga, and on 7 October, he scored two goals against Moreirense in their 3–0 win.[38] Over the course of the 2002–03 season, his representatives suggested the player to Liverpool manager Gérard Houllier and Barcelona president Joan Laporta.[39] Manager Arsène Wenger, who was interested in signing Ronaldo, met with him at Arsenal's stadium in November to discuss a possible transfer.[40]

Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson was determined to acquire Ronaldo on a permanent move urgently, after Sporting defeated United 3–1 at the inauguration of the Estádio José Alvalade on 6 August 2003. Initially, United had planned to sign Ronaldo and loan him back to Sporting for a year.[41] Having been impressed by him, the United players urged Ferguson to sign him. After the game, Ferguson said Ronaldo was ""one of the most exciting young players"" he had ever seen.[41][42]

""There have been a few players described as 'the new George Best' over the years, but this is the first time it's been a compliment to me.""

On 12 August 2003, less than a week after the friendly that impressed Ferguson, Manchester United signed Ronaldo for £12 million,[44] an England record for a teenager.[45] This also made him the first Portuguese player to sign for the club.[46]

Although he requested the number 28, his number at Sporting, he received the squad number 7 shirt, which had previously been worn by such United players as George Best, Eric Cantona and David Beckham.[47] Wearing the number 7 became an extra source of motivation for Ronaldo.[48] A key element in his development during his time in England proved to be Ferguson, of whom he later said: ""He's been my father in sport, one of the most important and influential factors in my career.""[49]

Ronaldo made his debut as a substitute in a 4–0 home win over Bolton Wanderers in the Premier League on 16 August 2003.[50] His performance earned praise from Best, who hailed it as ""undoubtedly the most exciting debut"" he had ever seen.[43] Ronaldo scored his first goal for Manchester United with a free-kick in a 3–0 win over Portsmouth on 1 November.[51] On 15 May 2004, in a victory against Aston Villa, Ronaldo scored the opening goal and later received the first red card of his career.[52][53] Ronaldo ended his first season in English football with a trophy, scoring the opening goal in United's 3–0 win over Millwall in the 2004 FA Cup Final.[54] BBC pundit Alan Hansen described him as the star of the final.[55] The British press had been critical of Ronaldo during the season for his ""elaborate"" step-overs in trying to beat opponents,[56] but teammate Gary Neville said he was ""not a show pony, but the real thing"", and predicted he would become a world-class player.[57]

""He has got the tricks and party pieces, we know that, but they're not much good unless there is something at the end of it all. We still have to remember, of course, that the lad is only 19 years of age. Considering that, you have to say he has got massive talent. His feet are mesmerising at times, and if he can couple that with some consistently good crossing, the future looks frightening.""

At the start of 2005, Ronaldo played two of his best matches of the 2004–05 season, producing a goal and an assist against Aston Villa and scoring twice against rivals Arsenal.[58][59] Ronaldo won his second trophy in English football, the Football League Cup, after scoring the third goal in United's 4–0 final win over Wigan Athletic.[60]

During his third season in England, Ronaldo was involved in several incidents. Ronaldo clashed with a teammate, striker Ruud van Nistelrooy, who took offence at the winger's showboating style of play.[61] Following the 2006 FIFA World Cup, in which he was involved in an incident where club teammate Wayne Rooney was sent off,[62] Ronaldo publicly asked for a transfer, lamenting the lack of support he felt he had received from the club over the incident.[63] United denied the possibility of him leaving the club.[64] Although his World Cup altercation with Rooney resulted in Ronaldo being booed throughout the 2006–07 season,[65] it proved to be his break-out year, as he broke the 20-goal barrier for the first time and won his first Premier League title.[66]

In the 2006–07 season, he amassed a host of personal awards for the season, winning the Professional Footballers' Association's Player's Player, Fans' Player, Young Player of the Year awards, and the Football Writers' Association's Footballer of the Year award,[68][69] becoming the first player to win all four main PFA and FWA honours.[70] Ronaldo was named runner-up to Kaká for the 2007 Ballon d'Or,[71] and came third, behind Kaká and Lionel Messi, in the running for the 2007 FIFA World Player of the Year award.[72]

Ronaldo scored his first hat-trick for United in a 6–0 win against Newcastle United on 12 January 2008.[73] His 31 league goals earned him the Premier League Golden Boot,[74] as well as the European Golden Shoe, which made him the first winger to win the latter award.[75] He additionally received the PFA Players' Player of the Year and FWA Footballer of the Year awards for the second consecutive season.[76][77] United reached the final against Chelsea
in Moscow on 21 May, where, despite his opening goal being negated by an equaliser and his penalty kick being saved in the shoot-out,[78] United emerged victorious, winning 6–5 on penalties after a 1–1 draw at the end of 120 minutes.[79][80] As the Champions League top scorer, Ronaldo was named the UEFA Club Footballer of the Year.[81] With his 2008 Ballon d'Or and 2008 FIFA World Player of the Year, Ronaldo became United's first Ballon d'Or winner since Best in 1968,[82] and the first Premier League player to be named the FIFA World Player of the Year.[83]

Shortly after, Ronaldo was linked to a move to Real Madrid, United filed a tampering complaint with governing body FIFA over Madrid's alleged pursuit of their player, but they declined to take action.[84] and he remained at United for another year.[85] 
His match-winning goal in the second leg against Porto, a 40-yard strike, earned him the inaugural FIFA Puskás Award, presented by FIFA in recognition of the best goal of the year;[86] he later called it the best goal he had ever scored.[87] United advanced to the final in Rome,[88] where he made little impact in United's 2–0 defeat to Barcelona.[89]

In 2009, Ronaldo transferred to Real Madrid for a then world record £80 million.[90] At least 80,000 fans attended his presentation at the Santiago Bernabéu, surpassing the 25-year record of 75,000 fans who had welcomed Diego Maradona at Napoli.[91] Ronaldo said, ""This is the completion of my boyhood dream, to be a Real Madrid player.""[92]

Ronaldo made his La Liga debut against Deportivo La Coruña on 29 August, scoring a penalty in a 3–2 home win.[93] He scored in each of his first four league games, the first Madrid player to do so.[94] His first Champions League goals for the club followed with two free kicks in the first group match against Zürich.[95] His strong start to the season was interrupted when he suffered an ankle injury in October while on international duty, which kept him sidelined for seven weeks.[96][97] Despite scoring 33 goals in all competitions and contributing to Real Madrid's 96 points in La Liga, his first season with Madrid ended trophyless.[98]

Following Raúl's departure, Ronaldo was given No. 7 for the 2010–11 season and scored 53 goals, helping Madrid win the Copa del Rey, scoring the winning goal against rivals Barcelona in the El Clásico, his first trophy with Madrid.[99] He also became the first player in La Liga to score 40 goals.[100] In addition to the Pichichi Trophy, Ronaldo won the European Golden Shoe for a second time, becoming the first player to win the award in different leagues.[101]

The following season saw Ronaldo score 60 goals across all competitions,[102] leading Madrid to their first league title in four years with a record 100 points and his runner-up finish to Lionel Messi in the 2011 FIFA Ballon d'Or.[103] He scored his 100th league goal for Madrid in a 5–1 win over Real Sociedad on 24 March 2012, breaking the previous club record held by Ferenc Puskás.[104] In the 2012–13 season, he scored his first hat-trick in the Champions League in a 4–1 win over Ajax.[105] Four days later, he became the first player to score in six successive Clásicos when he hit a brace in a 2–2 draw at Camp Nou.[106] His performances again saw Ronaldo voted second in the running for the 2012 FIFA Ballon d'Or, behind four-time winner Messi.[107]

Following the 2012–13 winter break, Ronaldo captained Madrid for the first time in an official match, scoring twice to lift 10-man Madrid to a 4–3 win over Sociedad on 6 January.[108] He subsequently became the first non-Spanish player in 60 years to captain Madrid in El Clasico on 30 January, a match which also marked his 500th club appearance.[109]

In 2013–14 season, Ronaldo was joined at the club by winger Gareth Bale and together with striker Karim Benzema, they formed an attacking trio popularly dubbed ""BBC"", an acronym of Bale, Benzema and Cristiano, and a play on the name of the British public service broadcaster, the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC).[110] He continued prolific scoring, with 69 goals in 2013, winning the 2013 FIFA Ballon d'Or,[111] and the FIFA World Player of the Year award, for the first time in his career.[112]

Concurrently with his individual achievements, Ronaldo enjoyed his greatest team success in Spain to date, as he helped Madrid win La Décima, their tenth European Cup, scoring a penalty in the 120th minute of the 4–1 final win over city rivals Atlético Madrid, becoming the first player to score in two European Cup finals for two different winning teams.[113] As the competition's top goalscorer for the third time, with a record 17 goals,[114] he was named the UEFA Best Player in Europe.[115] Ronaldo scored 31 goals in 30 league games, which earned him the Pichichi and the European Golden Shoe, along with Liverpool's Luis Suárez[116] On 4 May, Ronaldo scored a back-heeled volley in the closing moments of the match against Valencia, voted goal of the season by the Liga Nacional de Fútbol Profesional (LFP),[117] giving him the Best Player in La Liga award.[118]

During the 2014–15 season, Ronaldo set a new personal best of 61 goals, and after winning the 2014 FIFA Club World Cup,[119] Ronaldo received the 2014 Ballon d'Or,[120] joining Johan Cruyff, Michel Platini and Marco van Basten as a three-time recipient.[121] Madrid finished in second place in La Liga and exited at the semi-final stage in the Champions League.[122] With 10 goals, he finished as top scorer for a third consecutive season, alongside Messi and Neymar.[123] On 5 April, he scored five goals in a game for the first time in his career, including an eight-minute hat-trick, in a 9–1 rout of Granada.[124] His 300th goal for his club followed three days later in a 2–0 win against Rayo Vallecano.[125] He finished the season with 48 goals, winning a second consecutive Pichichi and the European Golden Shoe for a record fourth time.[126]

Cristiano Ronaldo became Real Madrid's all-time top scorer on 12 September 2015 against Espanyol, netting 230 goals in 203 matches, surpassing the previous record holder, Raúl.[127] Ronaldo also became the all-time top scorer in the Champions League with a hat-trick in the first group match against Shakhtar Donetsk, having finished the previous season level with Messi on 77 goals.[128] Two goals against Malmö FF in a 2–0 away win on 30 September saw him reach the milestone of 500 career goals for club and country.[129] He won the 2016 Ballon d'Or, his fourth, and the inaugural 2016 The Best FIFA Men's Player, a revival of the former FIFA World Player of the Year, largely owing to his success with Portugal in winning Euro 2016.[130]

In the 2016–17 UEFA Champions League quarter-finals against Bayern in April, Ronaldo scored both goals in a 2–1 away win which saw him make history by becoming the first player to reach 100 goals in UEFA club competition.[131] On 17 May, Ronaldo overtook Jimmy Greaves as the all-time top scorer in the top five European leagues, scoring twice against Celta de Vigo.[132] He finished the season with 42 goals in all competitions as he helped Madrid to win their first La Liga title since 2012.[133] In the Champions League Final, Ronaldo scored two goals in a 4–1 victory over Juventus to take him to 12 goals for the season, making him the competition's top goalscorer for the fifth straight season (sixth overall), as well as the first player to score in three finals in the Champions League era; the second goal was the 600th of his senior career.[134] Madrid also became the first team to win back-to-back finals in the Champions League era.[135]

On 23 October, his performances throughout 2017 saw him awarded The Best FIFA Men's Player award for the second consecutive year.[136] A day later, Ronaldo won the 2017 Ballon d'Or, receiving his fifth-time award on the Eiffel Tower in Paris.[137] On 3 April 2018, Ronaldo scored the first two goals in a 3–0 away win against Juventus in the quarter-finals of the 2017–18 UEFA Champions League, with his second goal being an acrobatic bicycle kick. Described as a ""PlayStation goal"" by Juventus defender Andrea Barzagli, with Ronaldo's foot approximately 7 ft 7 in (2.31 m) off the ground, it garnered him a standing ovation from the opposing fans in the stadium as well as a plethora of plaudits from peers, pundits and coaches.[138] In the final on 26 May, Madrid defeated Liverpool 3–1, winning Ronaldo his fifth Champions League title, the first player to do so.[139] He finished as the top scorer of the tournament for the sixth consecutive season with 15 goals.[140] After the final, Ronaldo referred to his time with Madrid in the past tense, sparking speculation that he could leave the club.[141]

Ronaldo joined Juventus in 2018 for €100 million, the transfer was the highest ever for a player over 30 years old and the highest paid by an Italian club.[142] Upon signing, Ronaldo cited his need for a new challenge as his rationale for departing Madrid,[143] but later attributed the transfer to the lack of support he felt was shown by club president Florentino Pérez.[144]

On 18 August, Ronaldo made his debut in a 3–2 away win against Chievo Verona.[145] On 19 September, in his first Champions League match for Juve, he was sent off against Valencia, his first red card in 154 Champions League appearances.[146] In the reverse (home) leg against Valencia, Cristiano won 100 Champions League matches, becoming the first ever player to do so.[147]

Ronaldo won his first trophy with the club on 16 January 2019, the 2018 Supercoppa Italiana, after he scored the only goal from a header against AC Milan.[148] On 10 February, Ronaldo scored in a 3–0 win over Sassuolo, the ninth consecutive away game in which he had scored in the league, equalling Giuseppe Signori's single season Serie A record of most consecutive away games with at least one goal.[149] On 12 March, Ronaldo scored a hat-trick in a 3–0 home win against Atlético in the second leg of the Champions League round of 16, helping Juventus overcome a two-goal deficit to reach the quarter-finals.[150] On 20 April, Ronaldo played in the scudetto clinching game against Fiorentina, as Juventus won their eighth successive title after a 2–1 home win, thereby becoming the first player to win league titles in England, Spain and Italy.[151] With 21 goals and eight assists, Ronaldo won the league award for Most Valuable Player.[152]

On 1 October, he reached several milestones in Juventus's 3–0 Champions League group stage win over Bayer Leverkusen including breaking Iker Casillas' record for most Champions League wins of all time.[153] On 18 December, Ronaldo leapt to a height of 8 ft 5 in (2.57 m), higher than the crossbar, to head the winning goal in a 2–1 away win against Sampdoria.[154] He scored his first Serie A hat-trick on 6 January 2020, in a 4–0 home win against Cagliari and became only the second player to score hat-tricks in the Premier League, La Liga and Serie A.[155] On 22 February, Ronaldo scored for a record-equalling 11th consecutive league game, alongside Gabriel Batistuta and Fabio Quagliarella, in what was his 1,000th senior professional game, a 2–1 away win against SPAL.[156] On 22 June, he scored a penalty in a 2–0 away win over Bologna, overtaking Rui Costa to become the highest scoring Portuguese player in Serie A history.[157] On 20 July, Ronaldo scored twice in a 2–1 home win over Lazio; his first goal was his 50th in Serie A. He became the first player in history to reach 50 goals in the Premier League, La Liga and Serie A, and becoming the second player after Edin Džeko to score 50 goals in three of Europe's top five major leagues.[158] Moreover, he became the oldest player, at the age of 35 years and 166 days, to score over 30 goals in one of the five top European leagues since Ronnie Rooke with Arsenal in 1948.[159] On 26 July, Ronaldo scored the opening goal in a 2–0 home win over Sampdoria as Juventus were crowned Serie A champions for a ninth consecutive time.[160] On 7 August, Ronaldo scored a brace in a 2–1 home win against Lyon in the second leg of the Champions League round of 16, which saw him finish the season with 37 goals in all competitions; the tally allowed him to break Borel's club record of 36 goals in a single season.[161]

Ronaldo played his 100th match in all competitions for Juventus on 13 December, scoring two penalties in a 3–1 away win over Genoa in the league to bring his goal tally to 79.[162] On 2 March 2021, he scored a goal in a 3–0 win over Spezia in his 600th league match, to become the first player to score at least 20 goals in 12 consecutive seasons in the top five leagues of Europe.[163] On 12 May, Ronaldo scored a goal in a 3–1 away win over Sassuolo to reach his 100th goal for Juventus in all competitions on his 131st appearance, becoming the fastest Juventus player to achieve the feat.[164] With Juventus's victory in the 2021 Coppa Italia Final on 19 May, Ronaldo became the first player in history to win every major domestic trophy in England, Spain and Italy.[165] Ronaldo ended the season with 29 league goals, winning the Capocannoniere award for highest goalscorer and becoming the first footballer to finish as top scorer in the English, Spanish and Italian leagues.[166]

The start of the following season came amid reports Ronaldo would depart the club before the closure of the transfer window,[167] despite Ronaldo and his agent Jorge Mendes reaching a verbal agreement with Manchester City over personal terms,[168] but the club pulled out of the deal,[169] and later it was confirmed that City's rivals Manchester United, Ronaldo's former club, were in advanced talks to sign him,[170][171] while former manager Alex Ferguson and several ex-teammates had been in contact to persuade him to re-sign for United.[172][173]

On 27 August 2021, Manchester United announced they had reached an agreement with Juventus to re-sign Ronaldo, subject to agreement of personal terms, visa and medical.[174][175] Ronaldo was given the number 7 shirt after Edinson Cavani agreed to switch to 21.[176] The first 24 hours of Ronaldo's shirt sales was reported to have broken the all-time record following a transfer, overtaking Messi after his move to Paris Saint-Germain.[177]

On 11 September, Ronaldo made his second debut at Old Trafford, scoring the opening two goals in a 4–1 league victory against Newcastle United.[178] On 29 September, he scored a last-minute winner in United's 2–1 victory at home to Villarreal in the Champions League, and overtook Iker Casillas as the player with the most appearances in the competition.[179] Ronaldo proved to be crucial in the next Champions League fixtures, scoring various last minute goals to help United qualify for the round of 16 as group winners.[180] On 2 December, Ronaldo netted two goals in a 3–2 home league win against Arsenal, which saw him surpass 800 career goals.[181] Struggles ensued, with a fractured relationship with his teammates and interim manager, continuing for two months,[182] until he scored in United's 2–0 win at home versus Brighton & Hove Albion on 15 February 2022, his first in the new year.[183] He finished the season with 24 goals in all competitions being named in the Premier League Team of the Year and the winner of United's Sir Matt Busby Player of the Year award,[184][185] but United finished in a disappointing sixth place and qualified for the UEFA Europa League; as a result, Ronaldo went trophyless for the first time since 2010.[186]

After growing dissatisfaction with the direction of United on and off the field, Ronaldo desired to leave to join a club competing in the Champions League, but a move failed to materialise, with various European clubs refusing a transfer, due to his age, overall cost of a transfer and high wage demands.[187][188] Shortly after, he fell out with manager Erik ten Hag who used him as a substitute, leading United to terminate his contract on 22 November, following an interview with Piers Morgan, where Ronaldo said that he felt ""betrayed"" by Ten Hag and criticised the management of the club.[189]

On 30 December 2022, Saudi club Al-Nassr reached an agreement for Ronaldo to join the club, signing a contract until 2025.[190] Ronaldo received the highest football salary ever, at €200 million per year,[191][192] including a guaranteed football salary of €90 million, with commercial and sponsorship deals bringing his total annual salary to €200 million.

He made his debut for Al Nassr on 22 January 2023, as club captain, playing the full 90 minutes of a 1–0 win over Al-Ettifaq,[193] and scored his first goal in a 2–2 draw against Al-Fateh by converting a last-minute penalty.[194] On 9 February, Ronaldo scored all four goals in a 4–0 win over Al Wehda, his first goal of the match being his 500th career league goal.[195] According to the BBC, Ronaldo's transfer to Al-Nassr led a ""revolution"" in Asian football, with many players from other leagues, particularly those in Europe, transferring to Saudi Pro League clubs for the 2023–24 season.[196][197][198]

In the final of the Arab Club Champions Cup on 12 August, Ronaldo scored both goals as they defeated rivals Al-Hilal 2–1 after extra time. Ronaldo scored six goals in the competition.[199] At the close of the year, Ronaldo scored 54 goals in all competitions for Al-Nassr and Portugal, making him the outright top scorer in 2023, reaching the same goalscoring record as in 2016.[200][201] On 27 May 2024, in Al Nassr's home fixture against Al-Ittihad, Ronaldo scored his 34th and 35th league goals of the campaign, surpassing Abderrazak Hamdallah's record for the most goals scored in a single Saudi Pro League season. He also became the first footballer to finish as top scorer in four different leagues, the English, Spanish, Italian and Saudi leagues.[202] On 31 May, in a 5–4 penalty shoot-out defeat to Al-Hilal in the 2024 King Cup final following a 1–1 draw after extra-time (in which he scored his side's second spot kick), he equalled Rogério Ceni's record for most top-level matches by a male professional footballer (1,225).[203]

At the age of 18, Ronaldo made his debut for Portugal as a substitute against Kazakhstan on 20 August 2003.[204] At UEFA Euro 2004, he scored his first international goal in a 2–1 group stage loss to Greece in his eighth international appearance.[205][206] Despite Portugal losing to Greece again in the final, Ronaldo made the team of the tournament, with two assists and two goals.[207] In the 2006 FIFA World Cup, at the age of 21 years and 132 days, Ronaldo became the youngest ever goalscorer for Portugal at a World Cup finals.[208] Portugal reached the semi-finals, where Portugal lost to France, with Ronaldo being booed during their defeat, due to an incident that occurred in the quarter-finals against England.[209] FIFA's Technical Study Group overlooked him for the tournament's Best Young Player award and handed it to Germany's Lukas Podolski, citing his behaviour as a factor in the decision.[210][211]

On 6 February 2007, Cristiano captained Portugal for the first time in a friendly against Brazil.[212] He wore the number 7 shirt ahead of UEFA Euro 2008.[213] Despite scoring eight goals in qualifications,[214] the second-highest tally, he scored just one goal in the finals, netting the second goal of Portugal's 3–1 win in the group stage game against the Czech Republic. Portugal were eliminated in the quarter-finals after a 3–2 loss to Germany.[215]

Ronaldo failed to score in 2010 World Cup qualifying.[210] He scored only one goal in the 2010 World Cup finals; despite this, he was named man of the match in all three group stage matches, against Ivory Coast, North Korea and Brazil.[216][217][218] His only goal of the tournament came in their 7–0 demolishing of North Korea, which was his first international goal in 16 months.[219] Two years later, in UEFA Euro 2012, Ronaldo was joint top scorer with three goals, enough for him to be included in the team of the tournament.[6] During qualification for the 2014 FIFA World Cup, Ronaldo scored eight goals. Despite this, Portugal did not qualify directly; Ronaldo scored all four goals against Sweden in the play-off to qualify.[220] At the tournament in Brazil, Ronaldo assisted a last-minute 2–2 equaliser against the United States,[221] and scored an 80th-minute winner in a 2–1 win over Ghana.[222]

In 2016, Ronaldo led Portugal to their first-ever trophy at the UEFA Euro 2016, although he was subbed off in the 25th minute in the final against hosts France.[223] He received the Silver Boot as the second-highest goalscorer, which gave him his fourth Ballon d'Or later that year. With the win, Portugal qualified and made its only appearance in the FIFA Confederations Cup held in Russia, where they finished in third place, with Ronaldo being named man of the match in all three of Portugal's group stage matches.[224][225]

In the 2018 World Cup, Ronaldo became the oldest player to score a hat-trick in a World Cup match, in a 3–3 draw against Spain.[226] The following match, Ronaldo scored the only goal in a 1–0 win against Morocco, breaking Puskás' record as the highest European goalscorer of all time, with 85 international goals.[227] For his performances in the tournament, Ronaldo was named in the World Cup Dream Team.[228]

Ronaldo led Portugal to victory in the inaugural UEFA Nations League in 2019, receiving the top scorer award in the finals,[229] and received the Golden Boot as top scorer of Euro 2020. Ronaldo also became the first player to score at five European Championships.[230] On 23 June 2021, Ronaldo scored two goals in the Euro 2020 match against France, breaking the men's goalscoring record previously held by Ali Daei.[231]

On 9 October, he scored the opening goal in a 3–0 friendly win over Qatar at the Estádio Algarve; with his 181st international appearance, he also overtook Sergio Ramos's record for the most international caps received by a European player.[232][233] In the following match against Luxembourg on 12 October, also played at the Estádio Algarve, Ronaldo scored a hat-trick in a 5–0 win for Portugal, thus becoming the first player to score 10 hat-tricks in men's international football.[234]

In the 2022 World Cup, on 24 November, Ronaldo became the first player to score at five World Cups, netting a penalty against Ghana.[235] Following a dispute with manager Fernando Santos, after their last group game against South Korea, he was dropped from the starting line-up for Portugal's last 16 match, marking the first time since Euro 2008 that he had not started a game for Portugal in a major international tournament,[236] and the first time Portugal had started a knockout game without Ronaldo in the starting line-up at an international tournament since Euro 2000.[237]

On 23 March 2023, Ronaldo scored a brace against Liechtenstein as he earned his 197th overall cap to become the most capped male footballer of all time.[238] On 20 June, Ronaldo made his 200th appearance for his national team, scoring the only goal of an away win over Iceland, in the Euro qualifiers, as he became the first player in the history of men's international football to make 200 appearances for his country.[239] On 16 October, Portugal secured first place in their qualifying group, following a 5–0 away victory over Bosnia and Herzegovina, with Ronaldo scoring twice.[240] The landmark goals saw him score in more than 100 goals in each of the last three decades (2000s, 2010s, 2020s).[241][242]

With his start in Portugal's UEFA Euro 2024 opener against the Czech Republic, Ronaldo became the first player to feature in six European Championships, having previously been the first player to appear in five.[243] Later that year, on 5 September, he scored his 900th career goal in a 2–1 victory over Croatia in the UEFA Nations League.[244]

A versatile attacker, Ronaldo is capable of playing on either wing as well as through the centre of the pitch,[246] and, while ostensibly right-footed, is very strong with both feet.[247] Tactically, Ronaldo has undergone several evolutions throughout his career. While at Sporting and during his first season at Manchester United, he was typically deployed as a traditional winger on the right side of midfield, where he regularly looked to deliver crosses into the penalty area. In this position, he was able to use his pace and acceleration, agility and technical skills to take on opponents in one-on-one situations. Ronaldo became noted for his dribbling and flair, often displaying an array of tricks and feints,[248][249] such as the step overs and so-called 'chops' that became his trademark;[250] he has also been known to use the flip-flap.[251]

His strength and jumping ability, combined with his elevation, heading accuracy and height of 1.87 m (6 ft 1+1⁄2 in), give him an edge in winning aerial duels. These attributes allow him to function as a target-man and make him an aerial goal threat in the penalty area; consequently, many of his goals have been headers.[252][253][254] Ronaldo holds the record for the highest recorded jump in football history, measuring 2.93 metres (9 ft 7 in), which he achieved during a match against Manchester United while playing for Real Madrid in the round of 16 of the UEFA Champions League in 2013.[255] Allied with his increased stamina and work-rate, his goalscoring ability improved drastically on the left wing where he was given the positional freedom to move into the centre to finish attacks. He has also increasingly played a creative role for his team, often dropping deep to pick up the ball, participate in the build-up of plays and create chances for his teammates, courtesy of his vision and passing ability.[248][252]

In his final seasons at United, Ronaldo played an even more attacking and central role, functioning both as a striker and as a supporting forward, or even as an attacking midfielder on occasion.[252] He developed into a prolific goalscorer, capable of finishing well both inside the penalty area and from distance with an accurate and powerful shot, courtesy of his striking ability.[252] An accurate penalty kick taker,[256] he also became a set piece specialist, renowned for his powerful, bending free kicks.[257] When taking free kicks, Ronaldo is known for using the knuckleball technique, which was developed by Juninho Pernambucano.[258] He also adopts a trademark stance before striking the ball, which involves him standing with his legs far apart.[259] Regarding Ronaldo's unique style of taking free kicks, former United assistant manager Mike Phelan commented: ""People used to put the ball down, walk away, run up and hit it. He brought in a more dynamic showmanship. He places the ball down, the concentration level is high, he takes his certain amount of steps back so that his standing foot is in the perfect place to hit the ball in the sweet spot. He is the ultimate showman. He has that slight arrogance. When he pulls those shorts up and shows his thighs, he is saying 'All eyes on me' and this is going in. He understands the marketing side of it. The way he struts up and places it; the world is watching him.""[260]

At Real Madrid, Ronaldo continued to play a more offensive role, while his creative and defensive duties became more limited, although not entirely diminished.[263] Initially deployed as a centre forward by managers Manuel Pellegrini and José Mourinho, he was later moved back onto the left wing, though in a free tactical role; this position allowed him to drift into the centre at will to get onto the end of crosses and score, or draw out defenders with his movement off the ball and leave space for teammates to exploit.[263][264][265] Madrid's counter-attacking style of play also allowed him to become a more efficient and consistent player, as evidenced by his record-breaking goalscoring feats. While he mainly drew praise in the media for his prolific goalscoring, Ronaldo also demonstrated his ability as an effective creator in this role.[266][267][268] This unique role has been described by pundits as that of a ""false"", ""attacking"", or ""goalscoring winger"", as Ronaldo effectively almost functioned as a striker at times with his central runs into the penalty area, despite actually playing on the left flank.[264][269] From 2013 onwards, under manager Carlo Ancelotti, he effectively adapted his style to the physical effects of ageing with increasingly reduced off-the-ball movement and general involvement, completing fewer dribbles and passes per game, and instead focusing on short-distance creating and goalscoring.[263][270][271] Since 2017, Ronaldo adapted his style of play yet again to become more of a free-roaming centre forward under manager Zinedine Zidane, a role in which he continued to excel and maintain a prolific goalscoring record; in this position, he earned praise in the media for his intelligent movement both on and off the ball, positional sense, link-up play and finishing, as well as his ability to lose or anticipate his markers, find space in the box and score from few touches or opportunities.[272][273][274]

In his first season at Juventus, Ronaldo continued to play in a variety of different attacking roles under manager Massimiliano Allegri, depending on whom he was partnered with. While he had occupied an increasingly offensive role in his final years at Real Madrid, at times he functioned in a free role at Juventus, either as a lone striker or in his trademark role on the left wing, in a 4–2–3–1 or 4–3–3 formation, in which he often switched positions with Mario Mandžukić. In this role, he was also given licence to drop deep or even out wide onto the right flank to receive the ball, and be more involved in the build-up of plays; as such, aside from scoring goals himself, he began to take on opponents and create chances for other players with greater frequency than he had in his final seasons with Real Madrid. Off the ball, he was also capable of creating space for teammates with his movement and attacking runs into the box, or finishing off chances with his head or feet by getting onto the end of his teammates' crosses.[275][276] On occasion he also played in an attacking partnership alongside Mandžukić in a 4–3–1–2, 4–4–2, or 3–5–2 formation.[277][278][279] He continued to play a similar role in his second season with the club under manager Maurizio Sarri.[276]

Ronaldo is widely regarded as one of the two best players of his generation, alongside Argentina forward Lionel Messi.[280] Winning his first Ballon d'Or in 2008 by a record-high vote count at age 23, over the next decade Ronaldo has often featured in debates concerning who is the greatest player in history.[281] Acclaimed for his prolific and consistent goal-scoring,[282] he is considered a decisive player who is also a game changer,[283] especially in important and high-pressured situations.[284]  In a 2018 article for Bleacher Report, former NBA star Steve Nash compared Ronaldo to Michael Jordan: ""On the pitch, [Ronaldo's] learned how to make his play—less explosive in individual movements—more successful for the team, and in that, I see the greatness of Jordan."" In the same article, Ronaldo was ranked first in the ranking of the 50 most influential people in sports culture for 2018.[285]

""In the six years we had him, you just saw his game grow all the time, and he was a fantastic player. Now you see the complete player. His decision-making, his maturity, his experience, plus all the great skills he has got, they all make him the complete player.""

Ronaldo is noted for his work ethic, elite body conditioning and dedication to improvement on the training pitch, as well being regarded as a natural leader.[287][288] On his longevity and ""extraordinary commitment to physical preparation"", Adam Bate of Sky Sports said: ""Dedication is a huge part of staying at the top and Ronaldo's focus is perhaps unparalleled within the game.""[261] While stating they were stylistically different players who shared an equal desire to score goals, former Brazil international Ronaldo praised Cristiano's approach to training, arguing that ""there are so few players who take care of their body like he does. I trained because I had to, he does it because he loves it.""[289] His drive and determination to succeed are fuelled by a desire to be talked about alongside other greats such as Pelé and Diego Maradona once retiring.[290] He is credited, along with his compatriot, coach José Mourinho, with inspiring changing fortunes of Portuguese football in 2010s and 2020s.[291] At times, he has been criticised for simulating when tackled.[292] He was also occasionally criticised early in his career by manager Alex Ferguson, teammates and the media for being a selfish or overly flamboyant player.[293] Jonathan Wilson of The Guardian opined that Ronaldo had made Juventus, who he joined aged 33 in 2018, weaker, due to ""his relative immobility"" in his mid-30s, even if his personal goal-scoring output remained high.[294]

During his career, Ronaldo has also been described as having an ""arrogant image"" on the pitch,[295] with Ronaldo stating that he had become a ""victim"" because of how he was portrayed in the media.[296] He is often seen moaning, gesticulating and scowling while trying to inspire his team to victory,[295] with Ronaldo insisting that his competitive nature should not be mistaken for arrogance.[296] His managers, teammates and various journalists have said that this reputation has caused an unfair image of him.[297][298][299]

Ronaldo has adopted several goal celebrations throughout his career, including one particular celebration which gained widespread coverage in the media, when he squatted and stared directly into a camera on the sidelines of the pitch with his hand on his chin.[300][301][302] After scoring a goal, he usually celebrates with a ""storming jump"" and ""turn"", before ""landing in spread-eagled fashion""[301] into his ""signature power stance"",[302] while usually simultaneously exclaiming ""Sí"" (Spanish and Italian for ""yes"").[300][303] This trademark celebration has been dubbed the ""Siu"" or siuuu in the media.[300][301][304] It has also been known as ""suiii"", ""siiuuu"", ""siii"" or ""Right Here Right Now"", formally the Cristiano Ronaldo celebration. Since Ronaldo first performed the gesture in 2013,[305] it has been widely imitated by athletes and personalities both in and outside of football when celebrating scoring in respective sports or a significant achievement, and is widely regarded as the most iconic association football celebration of all time.[306]

The gesture was first performed by Ronaldo on 7 August, during the 2013 International Champions Cup Final between Real Madrid and Chelsea. Ronaldo gave Madrid a 2–1 lead with a free kick when he headed in a cross from Isco, helping Madrid beat Chelsea 3–1 to claim the International Champions Cup and celebrating with his first ""Siuuu"". During an interview after the match against Chelsea when he first performed the gesture, Ronaldo explained he scored the goal and ""it just felt natural"" and ""didn't know where it came from"". He started doing it more often and when the supporters see it they are reminded of him.[307]

The phrase ""siu"" is derived from Portuguese sim, meaning ""yes"". This was confirmed by Ronaldo in an interview in 2023, almost a decade since he first performed it. Ronaldo explained that the phrase ""Siuuu"" simply means yes, but ""meaning it very strongly"".[308]

Both Ronaldo and Lionel Messi have scored in multiple UEFA Champions League finals, have regularly broken the 50-goal barrier in a single season, and are the two leading goal scorers in history. Sports journalists and pundits regularly weigh the individual merits of both players in an attempt to argue who they believe is the best player in modern football or in the history of the game.[309] It has been compared to several sports rivalries, among them the Muhammad Ali–Joe Frazier rivalry in boxing, the Borg–McEnroe rivalry in tennis and the Senna–Prost rivalry from Formula One motor racing.[310][311] Some commentators choose to analyse the differing physiques and playing styles of the two.[312] Part of the debate revolves around the contrasting personalities of the two players, as Ronaldo is sometimes depicted as an arrogant and theatrical showoff, while Messi is portrayed as a shy, humble character.[313][314][315]

""It's part of my life now. People are bound to compare us. He tries to do his best for his club and for his national team, as I do, and there is a degree of rivalry with both of us trying to do the best for the teams we represent.""

In a 2012 interview, Ronaldo commented on the rivalry, saying: ""I think we push each other sometimes in the competition, this is why the competition is so high.""[317] Alex Ferguson, Ronaldo's manager during his time at Manchester United, opined: ""I don't think the rivalry against each other bothers them. I think they have their own personal pride in terms of wanting to be the best.""[318] Messi himself denied any rivalry, saying that it was ""only the media, the press, who wants us to be at loggerheads but I've never fought with Cristiano.""[319] Responding to the claims that he and Messi do not get on well on a personal level, Ronaldo commented: ""We don't have a relationship outside the world of football, just as we don't with a lot of other players."" Ronaldo added that in years to come he hopes they can laugh about it together, stating: ""We have to look on this rivalry with a positive spirit, because it's a good thing.""[316] Representing archrivals Barcelona and Real Madrid, the two players faced each other at least twice every season in the world's biggest club game, El Clásico, which is among the world's most viewed annual sporting events.[320]

In a debate at Oxford Union in October 2013, when asked whether FIFA president Sepp Blatter preferred Messi or Ronaldo, Blatter paid tribute to the work ethic of the Argentine before taking a swipe at Ronaldo, claiming ""one of them has more expenses for the hairdresser than the other."" Real Madrid demanded and promptly received a full apology. In response to Blatter's ""commander"" on the pitch comment, Ronaldo issued his own riposte with a mock-salute celebration after scoring a penalty against Sevilla.[321] In August 2019, Ronaldo and Messi were interviewed while sat next to each other prior to the announcement of the UEFA Men's Player of the Year, with Ronaldo stating: ""I pushed him and he pushed me as well. So it's good to be part of the history of football.""[322]

After Messi led Argentina to victory in the 2022 FIFA World Cup, a number of football critics, commentators and players have opined that Messi settled the debate between the two players.[323][324][325] In September 2023, Ronaldo declared that his rivalry with Messi was over and ""gone"", after 36 official fixtures and 15 years of ""sharing the stage"".[326]

Ronaldo was named in the 2014 Time 100, Time's annual list of the most influential people in the world.[328] ESPN named Ronaldo the world's most famous athlete in 2016, 2017, 2018 and 2019.[329][330][331][332] Demand for a replica Ronaldo shirt has been high throughout his career. In 2008, Ronaldo's number 7 Manchester United shirt was the best-selling Premier League sports product.[333] In 2015, Ronaldo's number 7 Real Madrid shirt was the second best-selling worldwide, after Messi's number 10 Barcelona shirt.[334] In 2018, within 24 hours of his number 7 Juventus shirt being released, over 520,000 had been sold, with $62.4 million generated in one day.[335]

Ronaldo has established a strong online presence. The most popular sportsperson on social media, he counted over 500 million total followers across Facebook, Twitter and Instagram by February 2021, making him the first person to pass half a billion followers.[336] The most-followed person on Facebook (171 million), most-followed on Instagram (650 million) and most-followed sportsperson on Twitter (115 million), his sponsors earned $936 million in media value across his accounts between June 2016 and June 2017.[337] After announcing the creation of his YouTube channel, UR Cristiano on 21 August 2024, it became the fastest to reach the 1 million subscribers milestone,[338] doing so in 90 minutes.[338][339][340][341] The channel also became the fastest to reach 5,[342] 10,[343] 20,[344] 30 and 50 million subscribers.[345] It also became the most subscribed channel in Portugal, surpassing the Portuguese Nick Jr.[346] Computer security company McAfee produced a 2012 report ranking footballers by the probability of an internet search for their name leading to an unsafe website, with Ronaldo's name first on the list.[347]

With earnings of €720 million (£615 million) from 2010 to 2019, Ronaldo was ranked second in Forbes list of the decade's highest-paid athletes, behind boxer Floyd Mayweather Jr.[348] Forbes twice ranked Ronaldo first on its list of the world's highest-paid football players; his combined income from salaries, bonuses and endorsements was $73 million in 2013–14 and $79 million in 2014–15.[349][350] The latter earnings saw him listed behind only Mayweather on the magazine's list of The World's Highest-Paid Athletes.[351] In 2016, he became the first footballer to top the Forbes list of highest-earning athletes, with a total income of $88 million from his salary and endorsements in 2015–16.[352] He topped the list for the second straight year with earnings of $93 million in 2016–17.[337] He is the first footballer and only the third sportsman to earn $1 billion in their career.[353]

Ronaldo is one of the world's most marketable sportsmen: SportsPro rated him the fifth most marketable athlete in 2012[354] and eighth most marketable athlete in 2013.[354][355] Sports market research company Repucom named Ronaldo the most marketable and most recognised football player in the world in May 2014.[356] Since his reputation grew at Manchester United, Ronaldo has signed many sponsorship deals for consumer products, including sportswear, football boots; since November 2012, Ronaldo has worn the Nike Mercurial Vapor personalised CR7 edition,[357] soft drinks, clothing, automotive lubricants, financial services, electronics, and video games.[358][359][360][361] Ronaldo featured as the cover star of FIFA video game FIFA 18 and was heavily involved in the game's promotion.[362] His ""Sii"" goal celebration features in the FIFA series, accompanied with his own voiceover.[300] He was also the face of Pro Evolution Soccer, appearing on the covers of the 2008, 2012 and 2013 editions of the game.[363]

Ronaldo has made contributions to various charitable causes throughout his career. Television footage of the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami showed an eight-year-old boy survivor named Martunis wearing a Portuguese football shirt who was stranded for 19 days after his family was killed. Following this, Ronaldo visited Aceh, Indonesia, to raise funds for rehabilitation and reconstruction.[364][365] After accepting undisclosed damages from a libel case against The Sun newspaper in 2008, Ronaldo donated the damages to a charity in Madeira.[366] In 2009, Ronaldo donated £100,000 to the hospital that saved his mother's life in Madeira following her battle with cancer, so that they could build a cancer centre on the island.[367] In support of the victims of the 2010 Madeira flood, Ronaldo pledged to play in a charity match in Madeira between Primeira Liga club Porto and players from Madeiran-based clubs Marítimo and Nacional.[368]

In 2012, Ronaldo and his agent paid for specialist treatment for a nine-year-old Canarian boy with apparently terminal cancer.[369] In December 2012, Ronaldo joined FIFA's ""11 for Health"" programme to raise awareness among kids of how to steer clear of conditions including drug addiction, HIV, malaria, and obesity.[370] In January 2013, Ronaldo became Save the Children's new Global Artist Ambassador, in which he hopes to help fight child hunger and obesity.[371] In March 2013, Ronaldo agreed to be the ambassador for The Mangrove Care Forum in Indonesia, an organisation aiming to raise awareness of mangrove conservation.[372]

Ronaldo was named the world's most charitable sportsperson in 2015 after donating £5 million to the relief effort after the earthquake in Nepal which killed over 8,000 people.[373] In June 2016, Ronaldo donated the entirety of his €600,000 Champions League bonus after Real Madrid won the competition.[373] In August of the same year, Ronaldo launched CR7Selfie, a selfie app for charity to help Save the Children that lets participants take a selfie with him in one of several different outfits and poses.[374]

In 2007, C.D. Nacional renamed its youth campus Cristiano Ronaldo Campus Futebol (Cristiano Ronaldo Football Campus).[375] In December 2013, Ronaldo opened a museum, Museu CR7, in his hometown of Funchal, Madeira, to house trophies and memorabilia;[376] the museum is an official sponsor of the local football team União da Madeira.[377][378] At a ceremony held at the Belém Palace in January 2014, President of Portugal Aníbal Cavaco Silva raised Ronaldo to the rank of Grand Officer of the Order of Prince Henry ""to distinguish an athlete of world renown who has been a symbol of Portugal globally, contributing to the international projection of the country and setting an example of tenacity for future generations.""[379] In June 2015, astronomers led by David Sobral from Lisbon and Leiden discovered a galaxy which they named Cosmos Redshift 7 (CR7) in tribute to Ronaldo.[380]

On 23 July 2016, following Portugal's triumph at Euro 2016, Madeira Airport in Funchal was renamed as Cristiano Ronaldo International Airport.[381] The name change was subject to much debate locally by some politicians and citizens, who even started a petition against the move, an action criticised by President of Madeira Miguel Albuquerque.[382][383] On 21 September 2020, the Sporting CP's football academy in Alcochete, until then called Academia Sporting, was renamed Academia Cristiano Ronaldo.[384][385] In 2023, the Lisbon City Council approved awarding him, at the proposal of its president, Carlos Moedas, the Medal of Honor of the City, because he is ""a great Lisboner, in the sense of the passion he has for the city"".[386]

In June 2010, during the build-up to the World Cup, Ronaldo became the fourth footballer (after Steven Gerrard, Pelé, and David Beckham) to be represented as a waxwork at Madame Tussauds London.[387] Another waxwork of him was presented at the Madrid Wax Museum in December 2013.[388] A bronze statue of Ronaldo, designed by artist Ricardo Madeira Veloso, was unveiled in Funchal on 21 December 2014.[389][390]

The unveiling of the rebranded Cristiano Ronaldo International Airport took place on 29 March 2017, which included a bust of his head being presented.[383] The bust and the name change were controversial, with the lack of the bust's likeness to Ronaldo being ridiculed by comedians, including Saturday Night Live,[391][383] A year later, sports website Bleacher Report commissioned sculptor Emanuel Santos to create another bust;[392] however, this bust was never used and a new one was made by a Spanish sculptor, shown to the public on 15 June 2018.[393]

Ronaldo opened a fashion boutique under the name CR7 (his initials and shirt number) on the island of Madeira in 2006 and opened a second in Lisbon in 2008.[394] In partnership with Scandinavian manufacturer JBS Textile Group and the New York fashion designer Richard Chai, Ronaldo co-designed a range of underwear and sock line, released in November 2013.[395] He expanded his CR7 fashion brand by launching a line of premium shirts and shoes in July 2014.[396][397] In September 2015, Ronaldo released his own fragrance, ""Legacy"", in a partnership with Eden Parfums.[398] Since 26 October 2023, the new owners of Medialivre (Correio da Manhã, Record and Jornal de Negócios publisher) are a group of investors that include Cristiano Ronaldo through Portuguese company Expressão Livre.[399] In December 2011, he launched an iPhone game called Heads Up with Cristiano, created by developer RockLive,[400] and in December 2013, he launched Viva Ronaldo, a dedicated social networking website and app.[401]

Ronaldo's autobiography, titled Moments, was published in 2007.[402] His sponsor Castrol produced the television film Ronaldo: Tested to the Limit, in which he was physically and mentally tested in several areas; his physical performance was subject to scrutiny by world media upon the film's release in September 2011.[312] Cristiano Ronaldo: The World at His Feet, a documentary narrated by actor Benedict Cumberbatch, was released via Vimeo in June 2014.[403] A documentary film directed by Anthony Wonke about his life and career, titled Ronaldo, was released on 9 November 2015.[404][405]

Ronaldo has five living children. He first became a father to a son, who was born on 17 June 2010 in the United States.[406] He has full custody of the child and has not publicly revealed the identity of the mother per an agreement with her.[407][408] In January 2015, Ronaldo's five-year relationship with Russian model Irina Shayk ended.[409]

Ronaldo became a father to twins,[410] born on 8 June 2017 in the United States via surrogacy. He is currently in a relationship with Argentine-born Spanish model Georgina Rodríguez,[411] who gave birth to a daughter on 12 November 2017.[412] The couple expected another set of twins in 2022. The male twin died during childbirth while the female twin survived.[413]

Ronaldo's father, José, died of an alcoholism-related liver condition at age 52 in September 2005 when Ronaldo was 20.[414]

In January 2023, after Ronaldo moved to Saudi Arabia with his family having been signed by Saudi Pro League side Al Nassr, the rulers of the Kingdom made Ronaldo an exception to the rule that unmarried couples are not allowed to live together in Saudi Arabia. An unnamed Saudi lawyer told Spanish news agency EFE that ""the laws of the Kingdom still prohibit cohabitation without a marriage contract"", but Saudi authorities have begun to ""turn a blind eye and stop prosecuting anyone, even though these laws are applied when there is a problem or a crime"".[415]

Ronaldo is of (one-eighth) Cape Verdean descent through his great-grandmother.[416] He is a Catholic.[417]

After her son achieved legendary status in world football, Cristiano Ronaldo's mother, Dolores Aveiro, became a popular personality in Portugal to such an extent that advertising campaigns for well-known brands in the country, such as Maggi, MultiOpticas and Pingo Doce, have featured her in commercials.[418][419][420]

Ronaldo has said that he does not drink alcohol,[366] and he received libel damages over a Daily Mirror article that reported him drinking heavily in a nightclub while recovering from an injury in July 2008.[421] He also does not have any tattoos as he regularly donates blood and bone marrow.[422]

In July 2017, Ronaldo was charged with fraudulently evading almost €15 million in tax between 2011 and 2014, a claim he denied at the time.[423] In June 2018, Ronaldo was given a two-year suspended jail sentence and fined €18.8 million, later reduced to €16.8 million after reaching a deal with Spanish authorities. The sentence can be served under probation, without any jail time, so long as he does not re-offend.[424]

Ronaldo and another man were investigated by the British Crown Prosecution Service after a 2005 rape allegation was brought forward by two women. Within days, the two women withdrew their allegation and Scotland Yard later issued a statement declaring there was not enough evidence for a prosecution.[425]

In April 2017, it was reported that Ronaldo was being investigated by the Las Vegas Police Department for an allegation by a woman that he had raped her in 2009.[426][427] Documents, confirmed by Ronaldo's lawyers, state that Ronaldo paid a woman US$375,000 in a non-disclosure settlement.[426][428] Ronaldo and his lawyers issued a lengthy statement denying all accusations, describing them as an ""intentional defamation campaign"" with parts significantly ""altered and/or completely fabricated"",[429][430] a claim which Der Spiegel categorically denied.[431] In July 2019, Las Vegas prosecutors said they would not charge Ronaldo over allegations of rape; the statement added: ""Based upon a review of information at this time, the allegations of sexual assault against Cristiano Ronaldo cannot be proven beyond a reasonable doubt.""[432] The same woman, in September 2018, filed a civil lawsuit in Nevada accusing Ronaldo of rape.[433] The Daily Mirror, citing court documents, reported in 2021 that the woman sought £56 million in damages from Ronaldo.[434] In October 2021, federal magistrate judge Daniel Albregts recommended that the lawsuit be dismissed, citing that the woman's lawyer, Leslie Stovall, ""acted in bad faith by asking for, receiving, and using Football Leaks documents to prosecute"" the case, despite the documents containing ""privileged communications"" between Ronaldo and his lawyers. Additionally, Albregts stated that no evidence was found of Ronaldo's lawyers having ""intimidated [the woman] or impeded law enforcement"" during the 2010 settlement with her.[435] In June 2022, the woman's rape lawsuit was dismissed with prejudice in the United States District Court for the District of Nevada, as district judge Jennifer A. Dorsey ruled that Stovall's repeated use of ""cyber-hacked attorney–client privileged documents"" were actions representing ""abuses and flagrant circumvention of the proper litigation process"".[433][436]
